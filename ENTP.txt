Yeah, the last blow out I had with my ex went beyond where anybody else I'd known had taken things--like he just wanted to ruin me.  It's hard to describe.  Luckily the NT part of me knew that what...
I wonder if it the gender of each type makes a difference.
What do you feel like after you've had one of these episodes?  Have you ever gone past the point of no return with someone while angry?
This is really interesting.  I asked the same question in the ENFP forum and it seems with them there's a lot of outward expression of feelings that they don't always understand,  while ENTPs don't...
That's interesting.  I dated and ENFP guy who would kind of snap at me out of nowhere (at least it seemed like nowhere to me) and I figured out it was because I'd hurt his feelings in some way.  When...
How do you act when you're angry?  Defensive?  Hurt?
How do you act when you're angry?  Defensive?  Hurt?
Yes, the communication differences seem to be a big issue.  But it's only in romantic relationships--my ENFP friends think my abrasiveness, or borderline bitchiness as they put it, is hilarious.

118: INFPs care about authenticity, not INFJs. Are you certain you're an INFJ? INFJs have Fe, not Fi, and Ni in no way makes you care about autheticity. An INFJ would see it as selfless to change yourself...
If you're so sensitive about your identity, you're Fi, not Fe.
Billie Joe is an INFJ 4.
My intiition is telling me ISFP but I could be wrong.
Nick- INFJ? Juliette- INFJ Monroe- ISFJ? Could be INFP even? Bud- ISFJ? Adalind- ESFP Kelly- ESTJ Angelina- Not ENTP. I don't know about her. That's all I've got for now.
I sometimes have trouble with that too. Are you an enneagram 8? A lot of 8's have this problem.  You can't look at letters, you have to look at the functions. Do you think you use Te or Si more? ...
The tertiary function is developed decently enough. The inferior function is used in bursts because it's hard to control. You're either a mistyped ISTJ or you're not adept at analyzing yourself.
Lol. What subjects that aren't taught do you wish were taught?
You sound like a very successful ESTP. Your Ti must've been very well developed.
Ah, I figured. My ISTJ father never liked subjective things like the Arts either. ENTPs like it more because we're Ne dominant and we like to play around with ideas and be creative.
Wow, that sucks that they made Philosophy just the history of philosophy. They should've mixed that in with critical thinking, instead of just the history of the subject.
Thay, how do you know what your functions are? Did you take a test online? Those aren't always accurate. You need to read Jung's books on the functions and figure yourself out that way.
In my Freshman year of high school I had an ESTJ Algebra teacher, and he also hated Literature because it was subjective. I'm seeing a trend here. I think you don't like it because it excercises Ni,...

Your Ni wasn't well developed yet. That's why you weren't career minded.  Are there any subjects you wish were taught in school but aren't?
You sound like an INTP instead of INTJ. Ti is critical thinking. Te is all about facts.
Learning about religion excercises your auxilary Ti and inferior Ni, so that makes sense. What subjects do you wish were taught in school? What subjects do you think would develop your Se, Ti, and Fe...
Fascinating. Are there any subjects you wish were taught in school but aren't?
That does make sense. I certainly see the correlation there. What else do you think would develop Ni, as well as Fe and Ti?
Environmentalism is something we definitely need our kids to embrace more though.
^ The education system is really flawed. But what I want to know is what subjects you'd absolutely love to learn, that would really develop your Ni and Te a lot and such.  Also, that wouldn't work....
^ I loved all of those.
I liked English a lot too, and I was always adept at writing.  I had a lot of problems with people in high school as well. I was really nerdy and you know how teenagers are about that.
Those are all interesting, although I didn't like Math too much. I was good at it but not really interested in it.
Psychology was definitely interesting. I liked bio somewhat. If school was perfect in your opinion, what would it be like? What subjects that aren't already taught would you want to be taught?
I really liked Literature too. Are there any subjects you wish were taught in school but aren't?
Interesting. I was really good at Math at first too, then got bad at it, then good at it again.  What would the perfect school be like for you? Are there any subjects that you wish were taught in...
I can actually relate to that a lot. Whoa.  What would the perfect school be like for you? What do you think you'd really enjoy and really go far in life with?

I'm an ENTP and I'd like to see how the interests of my shadow personality compare to the interests of ENTPs. We might have a lot in common since we have the same functions.
I'd like to compare the interests of ENTPs to that of ESFJs... I think we might actually have a lot in common due to having the same functions.
I, an ENTP, am curious to compare the subjects I liked in high school to the ones you guys liked. I'm sure many of you loved Art class?

What subjects did you guys like in high school? I'm an ENTP and I liked the majority of subjects. Did you like less because you use Ni instead of Ne?

I'm an ENTP and I'm curious to see how my interests in high school were different than what INTJs like. I'm sure we're both generally interested in Science. What about Language Arts? Do you guys like...

First day of class after a gap year will be nice.
I would suggest telling them your boundaries, much like others are saying. Hassling you on that sort of crosses a line at some point.

btw seen the notebook lately :ninja:
Also one time I was at Walgreen's and spotted an Apple flavored Fanta drink and was like who drinks that.
I'm hard to kill! :ninja: Gia agrees with me and nice to meet you.

I also never liked guacamole which has avocado in it

This is just too delicious.
An actual ENTP would probably not allow another person to set expectations as to how he (or she) should behave, and would likely see any attempt to do so as a cheap manipulation.  But, anyway, do...
Yes, this.  I have two close friends who are INFPs.  (They have taken the tests, so I'm not just going off a hunch, but honestly it would be hard to see them as any other type.)  One of these...

Lewis Carroll is the archetype--the patron saint, if you will--of the introverted ENTP.

It's really more the story unseen.
Yes, that's right.  The idea is that an ENTP's understanding of external (or objective) reality is informed primarily by intuition--i.e., the perception of things not immediately perceivable by the...
And this, children, is how ENTJ's use Se to manipulate others.
Heh ... that is Ti drawing upon auxiliary Ne to satisfy inferior Fe.
Well at least you exhibit the expected response of an ENTP under pressure: grasping for Te.  As you deftly point out, it is difficult to quantify a psychological orientation that is couched in...
And/or you haven't read Carl Jung.
As I approach my dotage years, I often struggle to distinguish funny from the proverbial true-true.
That's what Ne is.
I'd give up the T.  What I perceive is too good.
This sounds like a very stressful process.  Can't I just have some Scotch and punch the wall in?  :wink:

I highly enjoyed this story, but I'm not sure that savaging a Canadian is bad ass.  I mean ... did you maybe bite off one of his arms or something?  :kitteh:

This is so deliciously understated.

Fluid was a poor word choice in so far as it suggests ambiguity or nebulousness.  I mean that ENTPs are one of the more consciously expressive types, and thus we are able to construct--and later...
Since you came here to understand your ENTP better, I will first say that what's going on in his mind is that you are depriving yourself of a wonderful experience and he is simply trying to show you...

What is the use of 'knowing' free will, when there's no way it is concrete in day-to-day life. You will believe you have 'free will' but it has no content.

What makes you think you use Ti?  And if you used Ni and Ti that would make you either INFJ or ISTP.
Good book. :)

A Child Called 'It'. Very dull so far.  And a biography about Catherine the Great. She seems ENTP - great character. :)
Probably ESTJ.
I took a professional IQ test a couple of years ago. A friend of mine (probably INTP) really wanted to do it and wanted someone to go with her, so I did.  My result was 134.
Now this is more INTJ. :) It's this kind of thing you missed out in your original post haha.
You didn't see anything Fi related? On a different note, what signs of Ti did you see?  I have no interest in proving anything. And I couldn't even if I did, as the only info we have is what this...
Haha yeah, it appears from reading simplistic articles on the internet that unless you're blind or have had your tongue cut out you can't be an N type. That's bull. Everyone uses all their senses. ...
They're both Ji functions, so yeah.   Ti doesn't promote values. Ti evaluates new ideas by comparing to the truths it already understands, Fi evaluates new ideas based on how much they value them.

Ti and Fi are VERY different. The OP is far too subjective to be a TP type. But, as you say, INTJ is possible.
Astronomy
ENTJ possibly. Your post was quite hard to read because it's all in one block for no reason.
It seems to me that Fi is stronger than Te, due to the fact almost the whole post is soaked in Fi-isms like [I] relate their opinion back to my personal value and try to understand that it is only...
I have some ideas about how to fix that. They're not very good ideas, but at least they're ideas!  Adam Savage   Comedy has always worked best when it is mean-spirited.  John Cleese  ...
ENTP is my guess.
I took a quick look through your original post and I don't think you're an NTP type at all. I saw zero Ti in the post haha (far more Fi-Te). My guess would be Fi-dom, possibly INFP.   Typing people...
Editor for a publishing company, marketing films or books, or a prostitute. :D
Extraversion, in typology, isn't about how social a person is. There are many shy ENTPs out there. It's just a question of whether your dominant function is facing inwards or outwards. ENPs are...
I think INTJ works.
I think you're probably ENFP. :)
You sound like an Fi-dom type. Probably ISFP, but INFP is possible too.
Beckii Cruel (XBextahX) Obvious ENFP
It's pointless trying to type a five year old. If the kid still acts the same aged ten, they'd probably be an Ne-dom.
If it doesn't then I have no idea what I've done with my life.
I don't think I've ever been so angry I lost control. I don't get angry very often at all, but I do get frustrated all the time. :)
Yes, I find it easier to think when walking (preferably indoors - outside there are too many weird things to look at).
Whereas we ENTPs are perfectly normal. :D
Haikus are a more reliable way of rating a person's intelligence than IQs.

554: 'First impression upon reading: ENFP (it was that endearing general excitableness that gave you away :tongue:)  But yeah function wise - Ne, Fi: logical conclusion = ENFP

I'm a vegetarian out of habit more than anything - I've never really been concerned with the whole ethics/health.  I could never be a vegan... I love cheese too much :happy:

I've only ever had one particularly profound experience (under the influence of psilocybin mushrooms). The experience was something akin to having your mind opened to the most thought provoking...
It works both ways - Fi provides us with a very personalised morality, the guilt can be overwhelming; yet there's a part of the ENFP searching for new experiences, new connections (both emotional and...
Just my take:  I keep seeing a strong link between introspection and xNxP types (both introverted and extroverted). Extraverted intuition combined with introverted feeling causes NFPs to engage in...
You notice extraverted functions more - its possible Ne seems like your dominant function, but its more plausible that you are driven internally by Fi except you aren't as conscious of it. Also...

Mainly Ne or Te, occasionally Fi.  Process = work out P/J -> if P work out extraverted N/S, if J work out extraverted T/F -> work out whether primary function is extraverted/introverted (thus...
In all honesty I think categorizing type relationships is stretching MBTI too far - we can have good and bad relationships with any type. For example - take two ENTJs I know, one of them I consider...
NT seems clear - function wise, his diagnosis seems to be based on Ne (What does this mean?, hidden implications) and Ti (the a priori cause). I would suggest an unhealthy ENTP.

Sounds interesting enough. I feel like if we were to fight a big war, our lack of unity would probably cause us to lose faster than anything our enemies could throw at us.

Truly, my avatar gives off such an ISTP vibe. Hm...ISFP.
If ghosts are real, and demons are real, are they the same thing? Could a demon leave a ghost? Or is a ghost a demon...?

I think if I asked my ENFP friends to stay in touch with me after high school, they would. So I'd say it seems possible that it could work out, especially if you're in love. Go for it!
*raises hand*  My experience with one, though...it didn't work out.
My SO told me he loved me last night! I feel like a goof for still feeling elated, but I do.

Isn't that generalising pro-lifers? Not everyone is like that, what happened to the objectivity of the ENTP, I'm afraid it's gone down the drain for you atm.

How about I'm not proud of being an ENTP. I'm proud of being me.

Trust me, I'm more introverted now, I doubt I'd want another me. I'm crap at small talk and people's first impression of me, is most of the time negative. Maybe introverts have this air of mystery...

ah that makes sense. I'm wondering, for an Si dom would they get these impressions very often, even from everyday objects?

On that note: an unwanted fetus is basically a parasite. It's living off of you while you resent it more each day. I think my opinion is more unpopular than yours.
I actually like that phase where children ask why constantly, like after everything you say. If you diligently answer everything, most stop after five to ten questions.
Yeah, many including myself. (1988)
I really like the quiz resource feature. You have made a lot of great suggestions, but I was wondering if you could keep links to the quizzes, as a directory of free quizzes on the internet. I agree...
He's my boyfriend, and I love him. I meant it as a metaphor. I should have said it was July in Iowa in my heart. Why didn't I think of it?
Oh shit, then what I really said was that this person leaves me cold.:bored:
This makes me happy and I have no idea why. Oh cruel world!
I agree with this one. I think rejecting someone because you care is just a guy thing...and totally illogical.

Just the other day I had the brilliant idea of building a fort out of my books.
When it scares you to come to the Thinker thread and realize that it's a bunch of T people EMPATHIZING WITH EACH OTHER. AHHHH!!!!:shocked:
See, I can easily lay down the law in any given situation, especially with small children. The problem is I feel very silly and inside I am laughing at myself. I think the smarter ones can tell.
Well, actually there are already robotic limbs for amputees. Been thinking about this, it actually could help a lot of people out.
Your handwriting reminds me a lot of my own.
You know your a thinker when you're watching  House M.D. and a patient projectile vomits blood everywhere and your only reaction is to take another bite of your ice cream.
Feelings can be a mask too, especially when used to manipulate.
You know you're a thinker when it comes as a shock to you that not everyone thinks as much as you do. Ti moment: I was homesick at summer camp when I was eleven or so and kind of worried so I was...
Maybe this isn't an N thing because I showed it to my lead teacher who is ESFP and she saw it too.
You know you're an intuitive when you wonder if Darner's avatar's donkey always had those cool wraparound sunglasses.
They said every animal. What about the animals that were already in the sea. Wouldn't that be a pointless waste of space. I also wonder about marsupials--kangaroos and koalas. Did they even have...
You know you're an intuitive when the spoon marks on the bottom of a bowl of yogurt polished off by a ravenous toddler look to you like an angry chimp.

I like watching people and trying to figure them out, so in the end it is worth the extra time spent.

That is something feeling related that Thinkers can be really good at, cheering people up with jokes, especially XXTP.

Thinking types can be pretty empathetic too. Also, like the use of the phrase, bullspit.
I once had a friend in high school who always wore her hair in two buns like Scary Spice. One day, I commented, Your hair looks like ears--bear ears. I meant it as a compliment but she was livid...
I think that the impulse to provide solutions is a form of empathy. It may just be hard for us to believe we don't have to do much more than be empathetic. I feel a bit uneasy myself when trying to...
I have done this before, only writing a letter in my head but not irl and then having to come back and do it for real.
ESFP then. It's the average of the three guesses because 2 are E and 2 are S while I and N only have one each.
I agree with this, though I still need to read the book. Other characters played by that actress (Agnes in The Poker House, the girl from Frozen River) also seem ISTP. The S variable was the hardest...
I could see Ni, because it increases the ability to worry about the dangers of sharing a toilet with the maid.
Well, maybe Hilly doesn't succeed, but she definitely tries to be when she Skeeter is procrastinating on putting her initiative into the Junior League Newsletter.

What if you went to a Buddhist monastery or something--some sort of retreat. You would meet like minded people who like being quiet and not buying stuff. :shocked:
I actually didn't. I really just stared at the screen, transfixed. I still enjoy that movie.
I like Da Vinci a little more. He was a true Renaissance man and would have made a much better dinner guest than Michelangelo.  As a consummate artist, the better one was Michelangelo though.

http://rs2img.memecdn.com/tits_c_1502265.jpg
To make it short: I can relate. It got 'healthier' in my late teens / early twenties.
Don't take everything so literally. I think 'you are too nice' was just a nice way of saying 'you don't understand'. Keep on being as nice as you can !     Niggard !

We lack in ethics of relationships. Noticing how others are affected by our actions is the last thing on our mind. That and noticing things in our immediate environment.

Why INFJ over ENFJ for Kyle?
I'd say ENFP for Nostalgia Critic - possibly ENTP. His style is taking things which are seemingly unrelated and finding connections.
You might benefit from any assessment of the future ESFP
ENTP At this point of time - only for someone in my family.
INFP  TMLT go on a cross-country road trip
Absolutely. Particularly if you're only focusing on the Ti aspects of the personality.
I wonder if Louis CK could be 6w7 instead of 7w6.
ENFP - INFJ wannabes :p TMLT like the rain
Best example I can think of is fictional - Dr. Robotnik. ENTP 8w7-3w4-6w5 sp/so Too much of a conqueror mentality to be a core 6 in my opinion.
I'm considering 6w7-8w7-3w2 as a tritype.  Anyone know of any good examples with ENTP in particular? I feel like this tritype is moreso common with ENTJ/ESTJ.

You have really small tits.
Don't worry too much about what others think of you. It really doesn't matter so much. Most of the people you envied in your younger years will grow up to be losers anyway.
My 7 wing is pretty strong. I'm all over the place but still have that naturally cynical and wary 6.
I'd say probably the XXFJ types are typically the most interested in me. Better chemistry with the NFJs but the SFJs are more common/frequent.

I wonder if the development of your cognitive processes can be affected by how you were raised and what kind of environment you grew up in...
Ok, so, the F and T have to do with what you prefer to use while making choices? Or with what you naturally use to make choices?
Yeah, that makes sense.
What is the main difference between an F type and a T type? (I've pretty much eliminated the idea of being an introvert.)
I'm 18. :P

Any other NTs not really have any hobbies? I'm pretty boring. If I had a hobby, it would be arguing with people or watching Star Trek.
My advice: go to community college. It's cheap and you can take classes in different fields to make sure what you want to do before you spend a boatload of money and time.

Wow, I'm surprised you did that too.  Why am I afraid that this person was ENTP :P
I'm not sure what the correct word would be. It was a seminar. So, you know, it was a big circle of people. And the teacher started talking about how truth (including morality) is subjective. I...
You think that's bad? I once got in an argument with an entire classroom of people, including the professor.
I'm in complete agreement. Attempts to stifle new hypotheses are a sin against science.
That's, in part, a valid point. I didn't mean to suggest that scientific data cannot be corrected or advanced. To the contrary, it's encouraged because that's how we get better scientific data. ...
As an ENTP who will argue with anyone about anything, I understand getting frustrated talking to people who are wrong (or who we think are wrong, or whatever.) It has lead me to mostly surround...
Ok, I'll keep that in mind. Thanks for the heads up.

I'm not trying to set-up a date with him. I just like talking to him.
You don't think it's kind of weird to ask someone days in advanced if they want to eat with you? To me, then it becomes like a date.
Ok, next time I'll just come out and ask him. It's tough for me because I worry sometimes that I'm pressuring introverts into hanging out with me when they'd legitimately prefer to be by themselves.
Sorry, let me clarify. I'm being ambiguous which is muffling my story.  I walked with him from class back to the dorm area, and then I said I'm going to go head this way to go eat at this place...
Ok, so I met this ISTJ guy in a class. He's really smart and I like talking to him. I usually walk and talk with him. He always eats by himself in the same place every day. One time I kind of invited...

I don't look in that forum much so I don't know. But I do think our need to be right, combined with our particular sense of humour, can be mistaken for a need to be cool, especially online.

ESFP ISTJ I don't think that has anything to do with MBTI, but on the Enneagram: Nine
I don't seek attention, it comes as a side effect of seeking stimulation.
I correctly guessed you were Enneagram Six from your first post in this thread and it sounds like your friend is probably one as well. That is likely why you share the traits you describe.

I can be a pushover, but I don't know if it's Fe or because I'm an Enneagram Nine. Dominant Fe definitely does not make someone a pushover in my experience, and I don't know why tertiary Fe would.

By this point, I can't recall my reasoning for typing him INTP,  but I agree with your analysis. He doesn't rally seem like much of an I or a T, so ENFP fits much better.

I do like spicy foods, but not if it just masks the flavor of whatever it is I'm eating. I think the variety you talk about is important, otherwise you might as well just chug a bottle of hot sauce. ...
ENTP. And clearly Corsican.
Ah. I see. Yeah, you probably wouldn't want to be my designated driver.
You have easy access to knives. I think the answer is fairly obvious.
The infamous blanket! Have you mailed it to me yet?
You'd hate driving with me. I go a different way pretty much every time I drive somewhere just for the variety.
Cool. I have a B.A. in philosophy, and fell in love with epistemology and skepticism. I could go on for days, but I don't want to derail the thread. I'd be interested in the book when it comes out...
That's the dilemma, I suppose. Do you get anything from being on the board? Extra pay? Maybe it wouldn't be so bad to speak up consistently and let the chips fall where they may.

I'm sure your elbows are just fine.
Most other MBTI types surround themselves with me.
Eh. 5/10. Look at how pointy her elbows are.
That's cool. Does the whole Brexit thing cause any problems with that?
I see. Is it easy to emigrate there?
True.
Just to get away from the breeze?
Sounds like a beautiful place! I've never experienced a sea breeze.
Hence the joke. I'm not sure what his type was, but asking obnoxious questions of those in power seems like an ENTP pastime.
Yeah, 26C sounds pretty nice. Where I grew up it regularly hit 45-48C in the summer.
It's already common knowledge that ENTPs are always and everywhere appreciated. If you don't believe that, just read about the life of Socrates.   At the moment, I'm appreciating a strong cup of...

Yeah, erotic creature works much better in my experience.
It really depends on the occasion. I'm fine with going to a close friend's house or having them over, but I tend to get antsy after a while and prefer going out. Pub/bar/cafe is good as long as it's...
Unprofessionalism.
Yeah. Maybe even a nice nap here and there!

Interesting. It was a combination of higher Fe and lower Si that helped me figure out I/E. I mistyped as INTP before because of some social anxiety issues I've had, but I never identified with a lot...

I be frank with you I'm attracted to myself the most so ENTP it is!
They like the melody of my own voice. Yes, I like to talk to myself a lot.
You are pushing my spam limits... I have answered OP question.
no she is not.
ENTPs have too much love. In real life I like ESTPs trolling style.
Sure and I would love to be a nice guy.
ENTP or ENTJ. I find MBTI to be somehow useless so in my mind you have what's needed. TeNi vs NeTi it should be easy to distinguish. Your tritype is fairly common in both cases. You seem a bit too...
It would be fun if she was going to go with your advice and this guy turned out to be an INTP or manipulative serial killer ENFJ.
I second Fi. My first impression was EXFP, went with ENFP because it kind of reminds me of my friend. Another thing to back it up. You sound like 4 Sx, which gives you false impression of being...
You will never get answer to this question darling :)
ENTP, I would rather have others pleasing me. Because my forearms are big enough and I can't do the yoga thing.

Quads That's a trolling mastery. Go by functions or descriptions to find the real type. There is no way you can go that wrong. Another reason why tests mean nothing.

What in blazes does this mean?

What would you guys say are your biggest fears? More of an enneagram issue, but whatever
Do you find it easier to communicate with ENTPs than other types? Why or why not?  Also I noticed you said she would admit she was wrong. That sticks out to me because I hate admitting I'm wrong,...
What was it that made it work? Can you elaborate?
So to what extent have you guys interacted with ENTPs in real life, and what happened?
Alright, I'm an ENTP here, and I don't really know much about ISFJs. However, in socionics, ENTPs and ISFJs are effectively duals (a dichotomy that is frequently overshadowed by the ENTP/INFJ...
Aha now we're onto something. Perhaps this is why INFJs and ENTPs are supposed to have a good dynamic; we love to theorize.
You mean interested in romantically? Also how do you tell when an INFJ is interested romantically?
So the best way to earn their trust is to infer their need to be cared about, and be proactive about it then?
So INFJs feel a need to be comforted and cared about, but simultaneously feel that admitting that need is selfish?
So how does one get an INFJ to really trust them? It must be very hard if you've never gotten that close to someone in person.
So I've read that INFJs are very reserved and hard to get to know. Do you often find yourself asking people questions to learn more about them, or does it require them to make the first move, so to...
Helping people also seems to be a big INFJ thing
So it seems like you INFJs are very concerned with life purpose and stuff  like that. Do you guys agree and can you elaborate?
Interesting. So would you say you and your fellow INFJs have a general lack of respect for society, or do you feel like traditions are usually important, but sometimes hindering? I know ENTPs really...
They should be categorizable to some degree. Personality typing is kind of all about putting people into these 16 categories.
So how would you describe an INFJ in your own words?
That is interesting because I don't believe most ENTPs would consider themselves particularly sensitive. For me personally, I hate showing any deep emotions whatsoever and sometimes I feel like...

I'm well aware of the difference.  What is your definition of a shy person?

I just ended a near 3 year relationship with an ISFP and you pretty much nailed every word in that post.  Incredibly accurate!
Huh, I miss typed myself as an INTP too but the ENTP description fits much better.  But when I'm left at home alone I turn into a bit of a monk.  when I was a kid I was much more extroverted.
As a grown up ENTP I think it took a long time for me to learn how to properly value other people's needs.  Maybe I still need to work on it.

1943: Some enneagram and MBTI types cannot fit together, for instance IxFP and type 3 for the reason I explained. If you're going to contradict me at least give me a valuable counter argument :/
Enneagram yes, MBTI no.
I don't think it's possible to be an INFP and a type 3.  Fi dom is all about being true to yourself and what you believe in and etc etc while type 3 is about being kind of nobody and defining...

You seem like an ISFP to me and I wouldn't say your Se is underdevelopped.  By the way, ISFP =/= artist hobo. ;)
In my opinion you're a very obvious ExxP and probably ENxP.  What do you think about those types?
Voldemort is ENTJ.  Same than Angelic Gardevoir, go Twilight Sparkle.

It depends.  As you said, relying based from an outside source of proof is indeed Te. Agreeing because it's how it's always been is Si. Agreeing because it makes sense to you (and not relying on...
This isn't a sensor thing. Yes it could be Si (past experiences), but it could also be Ti(logic).  Making generalizations about it is not function-related.
You're right. I should try reading more than the first sentence in a post next time. =P At least it still answers to the OP.
Si is not memory and is not related to memory. Si acts based on the past. If something was done in the past worked, it will most likely work again. Immature Si users don't like what's new because...
ENTP  Trolololololol I'm awesome cock
Lol what a stupid question.
What do you think about Fi/Te and Fe/Ti ?
Made Pee Eat.  That's quite an achievement.
From what you've said, you could be ENFP. Type 1 on the enneagram.  By the way, you can't conciously use both Ni and Ne. Same goes for Fe and Fi.
0% = 100% sensor 25% = 50% sensor 50% = Borderline 75% = 50% intuitive 100% = 100% intuitive   It usually works this way.
What types do you think you could be and why?
I guess it could depend where and how is the hit.   Type is about information processing, how the hell could it have a relation with pain tolerance?
I used to come to this forum a long time ago. If I don't get banned for multiple accounts, hello.
There's no way this is correlated to type. Males have higher pain tolerance than females, that's it."

I'm not particularly sporty, and I actually like school for the most part.

INTJ, I think
You could very well be right.

I'm can't decide between ENTP or ENFP for Tarantino.  Alfred Hitchcock was an ESTP, I read somewhere.  JJ Abrams: ENFP?
He is not an E; if you listen to the show that is obvious, I think. INTJ perhaps.
Mai Valentine from Yu-Gi-Oh
No way- INTJ, maybe... but I see you have him as your profile picture!
There is no way that Howard is extroverted. He is actually a very quiet, shy guy outside of the show who likes to be alone and doesn't like talking to his colleagues or going out (often).

Or maybe I should take a class on butchering meat? For, you know, livestock. Or something.
Should I maybe look into buying a large capacity barrel barbecue? Let's say, oh I don't know, one big enough to fit a human body in.
What exactly leads you to believe that ENTPs prepare for anything?   I can't think of a single instance in which I spent more than an hour in preparation for something.
This a thousandfold. I swear, it's as if they think their emotion-based subjectivity is objective truth.   ENFPs can truly be the worst.
The reason why is, because there is no reason.

The feeling is mutual. Conversations with an INTP are highly engaging, except for the other types involved, who generally look a bit lost.
Really, the way I see this is not as a joke at all. It's about having the best of both worlds. Why limit yourself by adopting a this or that mentality? Plus, boredom is the death of me, so let me...
ENTPs are logically random.   Edit: And randomly logical.
Not really. When hanging out with friends that are ENTPs, it's like we have our own language, so you can make an obscure joke about something and they'll understand it while others around you think...

This forum is more user friendly that most, if not all, forums I've been on. Not saying it's perfect, but it's not too bad.
The way I see it, people who seem themselves as percentages don't fully understand the theory (not to say that I do).  All ENTPs will have SOME ESTP tendencies. I'd rather be an ESTP, I think.

@fourtines  I don't really have any questions, I'd just like to say that this thread makes you a new addition to my list of favorite people on PC.
I'd agree and say ENTP purely on the basis of relating to everything you've said. Elaboration on my behalf seems pointless, as the others have done a fabulous job of it.

And this is how you find real INFJ's :tongue: I knew it was a matter of time before you all exposed yourselves
effenelle I think I can answer your first question. They are INFJ's, having a thread like that is too direct :tongue:

Or we are because we WANT you to be afraid.
Why not both?
Socially awkward? How dare you sir. I am not socially awkward, people simply come to me, so I feel no point in showing effort into befriending or speaking to others who do not.

I sometimes become burnt out but usually recover when I am appropriately stimulated like meeting friends, watching a film!

I have a ISTJ friend that I instantly felt a connection with, and while we have contrasting views I value the friendship.
That drives me nuts!  I don't want to seem neurotic but I often theorise what my latest fan's issue is.

ENTP - Ravenclaw.  While the house sorting was interesting, I have to admit that I was more intrigued by the wand selection.  There were far more options and descriptions.

From what I've been reading about ENTPs, it's unusual for them to be in a long term relationship.  From what I've learned from society, it's rare for anyone to be in a long term relationship.  :dry:
Perhaps if we dig deeper, we can find the core of this.
I've been married to the same woman for 11 years and we've been together for 17 years. Over half my life in one relationship.

I was just drawing from my own experience, my Ne likes to do things in that exact same way haha. She's by far the most complex character on the show so it's really hard to tell what exactly she is.

The first time you took it you got ISFP, so I'm not sure what your type is.  I'd say compare ISTP and ISFP, because ESTJ is very different from them.

Well, if it was personal, who wouldn't be sympathetic?  Being a thinker doesn't make you soulless :-/
I love him.  He has an accent, and he got a Doctor Who interview on network American television.  What more could I need?  The fact that he's ENTP is just the icing on the cake!:cool:

This is that one, I'm just posting it here for the people that don't visit the overall forum. A friend pointed me to it originally.
The following link is a map where you can post your location and MBTI type, let's show all those other types that the ENTP's are more awesome than they already thought because we're everywhere!! :D ...
After having gone through my first year, I can honestly say this is the happiest I have ever been :)
I do love ENTP's, we are wonderful people :)
This looks like it could be another excellent TV series, and if we are very, very lucky, not a bad movie.

Yeah, it's true.
Letting them lead unencumbered, we should challenge them so they can grow! :D
But that's just not as fun :P
I think ENTJ's definitely do a better job leading.   My suggestion would be to let an ENTP be a charismatic face to the people.

Yes, but they don't need to know that.  EDIT: And thanks for the commendation. I do try. ;)  As for my suggestion regarding INTJs?
I have sent word to the INFPs of our need for their immediate assistance.
My beloved INFP friends,  As you may or may not have noticed, there is a violent travesty unfolding. The INFJs have made a declaration of war against us. This act of malicious, blatant preparation...

Seems legit, gave me my type accurately as well as that of my spouse and sibling. And by bias, do you mean in the tests themselves or the communities frequently built surrounding it?
Tertiary functions seem to be more for how we help ourselves from my analyses of types. Almost like the shadow functions' descriptions. It can be developed to be more positive and beneficial for...
On the contrary, I feel extremely satisfied when a problem is solved. Also, just because you're messy doesn't mean you're not a J, different people have certain qualities from the other side of the...

I think Kirito's INTP. Analyzing (NT) and awesome ability, but he doesn't conform to the rules or traditions that he's expected to (thus P, not J).

its his fault for being drunk. anything for happening after can only be brought upon himself.
Maybe if you put more effort into better comebacks I would listen more. until then, I guess not much is going to get through.
keep trying. right now I think you just felt your dick. suddenly seem you in a better mood.
I don't understand why you keep replying. you're disses don't make much sense and you can't come up with a good comeback. please stop. You're making us ENPs look bad. its painful to watch.
I did after moron.  everyone gets a turn.
haha, we don't bring the asshole out of you guys. We just a hold up a magnifying glass because we were worried you were blind.
ah finally. I see you have consumed tequila, sounding smarter by the minute.
yes it is. That's why I got 2 other holes.
You kidding? make-up sex is the perfect time to keep arguing :)
Of course you would be the one to know.
well that was a pretty fast cock.  No pun intended. . . . .
and jokes about you. wait. same thing. scratch that.
you shouldn't be proud that judgment was made about you.
theres too many of them. We get rid of the shortest ones.  Bye byee.
finally typed yourself as an ESTJ?
Ha. but after reading what I said it sounds like a skinny dick. Ohhhhh there you are November.
hehe they got their puppy eye look, theyre fine.
I don't recall saying I was interested. I guess I was wrong, you CANT do better.
Oh my computer. It looks like a French fry trying to ride tangerines.
That's just like an INFJ of you to defend an INFP
Im laughing too hard to debate right now. for once an INFJ made my day
Your sarcasm. damn, sounding like an INFP on her period here. you can do better INTP.
Yes my chandelier. Thanks for reminding me, damn thing has been collection spider webs for years.
Good. I'll break it down twice as better now.
You cant just pop in and out of my arguments. You haven't said anything for a long time, either your slow to think of something to say or your being lazy. Either way keep up or im not wasting my time...
Yeah thanks for handling this one, I lost count of all the idiots. thanks for keeping them in check. Ooh what happened with an ENFP sicko??
I would rather not use one when I have much more interesting things to do, for example, tear down your argument.
You can stop talking to your mirror now
five thousand tries to me is about 2 seconds. Meanwhile INFJs need 2 years just to write about one day in their diary of feelings.
hehe. you see my computer isn't as fast as my brain, and it couldn't take my genius, so it froze in amazement. Then all of a sudden bam! it just posted it twice because even the internet wanted...
INFJ thoughts are like dogs with rabies, runs in circles and all you see is crazy.
oh my god im dying of laughter
I'll have you know I trained my attention span to last atleast 4 seconds. If only INTPs could treat people with the dignity they do with their own thoughts
I'll have you know I trained my attention span to last atleast 4 seconds. If only INTPs could treat people with the dignity they do with their own thoughts
spreading my observation skills to the blind and reckless, yes i think i'm finally being productive. If only others could live up to their standards.
Maybe figuring things out isn't for you, hop back on your motorcycle and get your usual of tequila, you seemed smarter with it
I may just be ENTP then. I've been contemplating whether I am ENTP or ESTP for about a year now :laughing: and yeah that sounds like me, I love thinking about things just for fun.

What if owls pulled a prank on the cat? What if the cat didn't have messy hair but instead each owl vomited their own piece of hairy prison on it? Could that be the nightmare? :th_o:
You'll be fine as long as the other owls don't serve you hairballs for breakfast.
The nightmarish part is to wake up with messy hair when meeting your owl friends. :ninja: They're friends :ninja: The nightmare is not what you think :ninja: Your cat loves you :ninja:

The way you connected, would have just been because of your introversion.  It's actually very much easier to work out your socionics type btw, have a look at the quadras:  Alpha Quadra -...
That's why they make the cognitive function ones near impossible to follow :proud:
Ouch, not sure you should be so quick to judge, seeing as ENTPs have a tendency to disappear sometimes. You might be right though of course, can't speak for all ENTPs, others just want things.

Yeah, that's it, you described it perfectly, you're definitely and ENTP, don't worry about that ENTJ INTP nonsense :laughing:.   It's kind of hard to describe, like gossipy or something I guess.
Okay, I worked this one out a little while ago, I was trying to use the floor function because I didn't realize that the lines(eg. |x|) mean absolute value. After that, I've worked it out, and you're...
okay, are you kind of hyper, always suggesting crazy ideas, playing with 'toys' and causing mischief to satisfy some kind of chaotic urge (which I figure it to kill boredom) when out with people? Or...

Hi all, I'm posting about a topic which I have struggled for some time with and wondered if anybody could share some thoughts.  So, you can pretty much describe me as an anti-foodie. I don't get...

I'm pretty desirable. I've had no problems with people being romantically interested in me. And lemme check, yes I'm a female ENTP! :o  It's the Ne bubbly that attracts people. When you're...
I know an ISTJ that has this really intense stare that's unnerving. He's been told by others too, of this stare. It's like he's boring into your soul. Actually, I don't hold eye contact that much....
As a generalisation, yes, most guys probably don't like a socially dominant woman. But I'm not going after most guys. I'm going after one person that I can be with that makes me happy. I don't need...
I agree with your incentive. I want to orgasm because it feels good, and there's no reason to stop trying just because I don't succeed. I never felt awkward though. I was very direct and honest and...

I think we want someone who is excited about life the same way that we are. Yes, our interests change rapidly. What do you expect, we're ENTPs. We treasure someone who can keep up with us, joins in...
Being an ENTP means I pride myself on my Ne-Ti, which allows for lots of brainstorming, lateral thinking and creativity. It means I can be relatively good at improvising and looking at big picture...
Attitude determines your happiness. Not what you have. Not what you lack. Not if you're smart, or dumb, or innocent or not.  Being wise may give you a more balanced attitude towards life. There's a...

This. Plus teabagging. And probably trying to aim some other substance over the bushes too.
Yes, I had that morph. I mistyped as an INTP for the longest time. Don't know how people can mistype as an INTJ though. Their functions are all different from ours.  However, I think for my case it...
Apparently ENTPs have high standards for who they consider friends. If you think about it, most of us are looking for a mind mate to play with. Someone who can keep up with our antics, appreciate us...
Have you found J types to be domineering over other people's lives? I can understand if a J type wants to keep to their own structure, but would they try to drag the P type into it too? Surely there...
Be happy and have fun while you're here.
Yes, I attract emotionally screwed up people. But everyone is somewhat screwed up. I'm just easy to talk to, and I find out everyone's secrets. But it's annoying, because I feel like I'm surrounding...
This is funny, because I thought everyone was going to blab about how they're so popular and charming, but no! Likewise, few friends, many acquaintances. I don't have a permanent group of people I...
I should print this out and frame it.
I wish my type existed so I could have a more appropriate asshole description. Surely there's heaps of negatives to point out in an ENTP.
If I have managed to seize or create an opportunity where I engage with someone/something that captures my interest, the environment doesn't matter too much. It can be distracting and annoying, and...
I plan for the future, but thankfully my Perceiving nature recognises that life is so unexpected and volatile that, well, just take it as it comes. I have ideas of where I'd like to be at, but I'm...
LOL, fuck her. Fuck it. Fuck everything. IDK, anger makes me get over shit. Dunno how the ISTP does it though.  Just no talking to her then. It's better if she's out of your life for good. Starts...
If you keep chasing her, she may just run away completely. Already she's started to withdraw. I think you've shown her enough that you care about her, but if you come off as clingy she might freak...
I do completely agree that each individual is different, no matter how we may attempt to categorise the human psyche. But within the context of this discussion, being on a forum focused on...
Maybe that's proof you can still be surprised by how others react, then. :p  Personally I didn't see why you'd be so annoyed by something as simple and as ordinary as the fact of having to deal...
What do you mean Si-users get you down a lot?  Yay for 7w8s! I'm relatively new to Enneagrams though, still need to sort the rest of my tritype/instincts out. Hahaha, it's a bit disheartening to...
I think your attitude toward life greatly influences how you experience it, regardless of the situation you're in. If you think there's nothing left to learn, then you'll continue to learn nothing...
I thought the theory is that you attempt to develop your inferior functions later in life. There's a constant tug-of-war of the dominant and inferior functions, but if the dominant is allowed to...
Goodness, what is it with everyone and being able to schmooze their way out of things?  But granted, I haven't been lucky to get freebies or anything but I don't think I've gotten into trouble that...

zobot Very interesting analysis, but I hope that applies to ENTPs too, like me. :p My Fe isn't great, but it's workable. Oftentimes I do have trouble picking up on why I'm upset and need to sit down...
Thorweeps I wish I could tell you. I haven't met many of my own type. I think ENTPs aren't too plentiful, particularly female ones. I can be found in almost any sort of setting and playing any sort...
I think that everything you've said is very true. It's a shame because she is a nice person, and yes, her simplicity is charming and easy to deal with. But her problems do outweigh her positives. As...
What do you think would be the catchphrase for each MBTI type? I often find myself going I'm bored, which seems a bit ENTPish considering how we pursue many interests and are always trying to...
Does that mean when two individuals with low ranking Fe get together that they can tune in on the other's emotional wellbeing before they know of their own?  Just thought of my ISTP and how even...

2806: 'Thanks so much everyone, this cleared up a lot. :proud:
I have heard of both- but ENTP's shadow is not INFJ. It's INTJ. Isn't it? So what's with that?
This is kind of a random thread, and I don't really know where its going, but I would appreciate your thoughts.  I find that people, very often, flip types entirely depending on situation. I also...
Dad: INFP Mum: ESTJ most likely  Childhood was weird and crazy and fun. Totally didn't get them, they totally didn't get me, but that really did make it interesting. You can't choose family, but...
Yup, the Joker sounds about right. I can relate- I would totally dress up my henchmen in matching makeup so they look just like me. But not as good-looking. Like, channeling my vibe, but not stealing...
Environments. For example, a rainy day in the city with wet concrete and musty smelling air may remind me of my grandmother. I dunno, just an example. But something like that- its the strongest...
Personally, I call myself an anti-villain. But to each his own, I guess. :wink:
1) I think I'd be fine for a little while, I could take it for a few days, max. Then I'd just go downhill from there. 2) I don't think any type could outdo any other in this scenario. I think it...
Tbh, since astrology is not scientifically based, I don't think there would be much of a correlation. That being said, I am an ENTP Taurus.
ENTP Hero: Upbeat and friendly, but under the surface a bit manipulative and shady. Prone to whining and snarkiness, but ready to step up when the situation demands it. A very cerebrally oriented...
Why not embrace confusion?
Flaming Bassoon:  ESFP
Why bother to bother if you do not like being bothered?
Why take this so personally?
Why not. :wink:
Lol, I flirt for fun, but if I'm serious and really like some one:  1) Deny, deny, deny. (anyone get my reference by chance...?) 2) Deny a little more. 3) Admit at the pressure of ENTJ friend....
More like:  What the fuck are you doing? Translated: I'm in. Move aside, so I can hijack, I mean collaborate.
This right here is why I appreciate INFJs. You guys are dope-tacular.
Thine horrid image doth unfix my hair.  Also:   Demetrius: Villain, what hast thou done? Aaron: That which thou canst not undo. Chiron: Thou hast undone our mother. Aaron: Villain, I have...
Why say harder than it sounds, when the correct phrase would be harder than it reads?
Lol, I'm ENTP, but apparently I'm unique amongst my type for actually taking joy in dressing up. I treat fashion as an artistic experiment- Fun, personal, and malleable.
Honestly, I think it depends on what you consider charming.
Flynn Rider.     That is all.     :)
ENTP- Pottermore typed me as Slytherin. Didn't see it coming, I thought Ravenclaw too. But it makes sense the more I think about it. I'd say that MBTI doesn't necessarily have a consistent...
Sometimes, I question my sanity and ability for true empathy. (Not sarcastically).
When I was a kid, I was generally accepted as one of the guys. But in reality, I am a closet girly-girl. I've learned to accept myself as what I am: a weird little tomboy with a feminine streak. Or...
Also, I went off of Emerson's writing style, so that may not be very accurate :blushed:

To me at least, you seem more Ni than Si. Either way, your friend is the opposite.  In my experience, ESFJs and ENFJs are people oriented, but if I had to guess, I'd say the ESFJ is your friend, and...
I dunno, you're still sounding like me.... lol, but ENTPs are like all types: they vary. I am ENTP and enneagram 3. ENTPs are considered the most introverted of the extrovert types, I for one swing...
ISFPs are practical, efficient, fairly withdrawn, and need their space. So if you are looking to pick on him, get in his space. Boss him around, push him around. Be the boss, belittle him (they hate...
Like the above posters, I'd fairly confidently say ENFP.
INFPs can be creative in lots of different ways. I know INFPs that are visual artists (oil painting),writers, and even tech/AV crew (behind the scenes in theatre.) I wouldn't rule out INFP just...
I agree with the above, you remind me of an INFP family member of mine- scarily so!  I'd pretty confidently say INFP.
I'd say ENTP, mostly because you remind me of myself, lol. :tongue: Any particular reason towards your considering INTP?
Also, your dislike of conflict and arguments is very ENFJ. ENFJs dislike the negativity of disagreements of any kind. Ex: and an ENFJ sibling of mine has to actually get up and leave the room...
Edit: Your don't want to bother others attitude again, strikes me as very ENFJ.  http://www.personalitypage.com/ENFJ.html  It's natural to their personality type that they will tend to place...
You remind me of an ENFJ I know. Do you repress thoughts and emotions for other people, or for yourself? ENFJs are often very willing to make sacrifices for the greater good and to preserve the...
I can be very cold and calculating when: 1) I need to be to get things done. 2) I am angry with, or have otherwise been led to dislike, you. 3) That time of the month.   I can also be truly and...
Yes, so true :laughing:  Those ENTJs need to make some better rules, otherwise they need to stop yelling at me for not following them.
ENTP- Money. Money is always a safe bet. :tongue:
I'm an extrovert, and I've always loved introverts- they just need to have space sometimes.  Also, the internet is a venue open to both the intelligent and the... not so much. And most...
I guess they are both pretty emotionally manipulatable. I'm always around INFJs (they are the rarest type, too. Wouldn't have thought so, considering how many I know.) I find that if I connect with...

Maybe I have found a well-developed ISTP but my boyfriend does not have a cold heart at all. He is kind and generous -- he's just not given to expressing such things in words.
Yup. And once I dismiss someone -- I can act like they don't even exist! People hate that. I've also learned that people HATE being called out and I have no qualms about doing that -- most people I...

I got 26, but I am also quite depressed so I feel like back in the day it would have been higher.
What do you mean one step away? they're pretty much identical in juxtaposition.
Trolling, getting high, netflix, there are a lot of things to do to cope, I've heard ENTP's are one of the most introverted extroverts so it's not really that hard for me, personally at least.
I used to be very creative, puns, plays on words, people told me I should be a comedian, but overtime I lost my gift completely and I started to feel numb of emotion, I don't know what happened.

INFP with lack of T (Ti) - Not sure.  INFP with intelligence and well-developed T (Ti), sounds awesome.

Personally I don't think the so-called loop theory is very logical.  It usually starts from the common misunderstanding about the tertiary function, that:  1. The tertiary function is the 3rd...
Thank you, but that's too much detail for me. I personally prefer more intuitive and comprehensive explanation (like the very basic cause/relationship/reasons).   BTW You seem to claim that INTJ...
Axis-system hmm.. Are you saying INTJs and ESFPs have something specific in common, since they both have Te/Fi axis? I'd like to know. I'd think of them as rather polar opposite.
My view is that Fi and Ti are not necessarily contradictory. They would collaborate quite often in certain occasions, just like how Fe and Te collaborate.  Such statement that Ti and Fe goes...
I guess we do agree on the sense that Tertiary and Inferior functions have a different nature compare to Dominant and Auxiliary which are pretty much genuine.  But I wouldn't call it powerful...
(I wrote basically the same post somewhere else before, I'll repeat it since I think it fits quite well here)  I consider the function stack (dom-aux-ter-inf) valid, but NOT in the order of the...

You're right about the point that the meaning of ENTP is directly associated with the function stack (I personally don't like the word stack here, it's too 1-dimensional).  I don't disagree...
No. I'm implying that tertiary and inferior are not necessarily third and fourth. If you firmly believe that (I hope you don't mean this), say, Si is really the 4th strongest function for ENTP...
Try to read IDontThinkSo's signature link, it's up the page. I think it might help you understand more about the variety within ENTP (regarding the use of Ti/Fi).
They say ENTPs are the most introverted extroverts (Thanks to Ne+Ti). (Some say INTPs are the most introverted introverts too) This is maybe why many ENTPs are confused whether they are INTP. ...
I agree that it's very frequent that many people only reinforced their former strategies. It's almost sad in some cases.  Ideally this counter-force would have to get trained and utilized to some...

That's inferior extraverted thinking : if some experts say something, then it has to be the truth, there's no need to have a deep understanding of what we're talking about ;p

I didn't say that ESTP's were void of depth, I said a certain depth. ENTP's are also missing a certain depth that ESTP's have. We've clearly missed each other's depths in that post.

weird,aloofish,doubtful and other stuff.
hmmm...i think bonnie is an enfj
i have thought about it a while ago(not in depth,so correct me if i am wrong):naruto:either a 6w7 or 3w2,sasuke:3w4,shikamaru:9w1,madara:3w4,raikage:8w7 and minato:either 1w9 or 5w6.
for me the most attractive types are 9w1(the peacefulness),8w7(hot and sort of gentle),2w3(beauty and impulsiveness),3w4(beauty,hot and kind of fun)and 4w5(deepness and beauty).my tritype:6w7,1w9 and...
it is nice to have a healthy type on my tritype for a change lol thank god i realized that things are perfect the way they are.
guys i m sorry for coming here again but i must correct my tritype which most certainly is:6w7,1w9 and 4w5,and not 9w1 in the gut center after all trust me i have done a variety of things to be sure...
i finally discovered for sure my tritype:6w7,9w1 and 4w5(in that exact order)
maybe there is some chance to these types create a relationship let me see,both have a certain compliance,competency and independency so maybe it could work(6w7,9w1,4w5).
that is ridiculous,7s also have anxiety,it is just less apparent.
i actually do not believe in any of these dimensions but maybe there are similar places hahaha(6w7,4w5 and 9w1).
heaven:2w1,6w7,5w4,9w1,9w8,4w5,7w6,1w9purgatory:6w5,1w2,5w6,8w9,3w2,4w3 and hell:3w4,2w3,7w8 and 8w7.
i suppose that good matches for like all types would be:9 and 7,1 and 3,2 and 7,3 and 1,4 and 6,5 and 1,6 and 4,7 and 9 and 8 and 4(it is harder to find types that comine well with twos,fives and...

it is hard to put a general look of who we are in here and being a seeker makes it even harder because i always have doubts about myself.

9w1 to be exact,the people of canada do not seem to have that expansive energy of 9w8 on the other hand they have the intellectual rigor of 1 energy(6w7,9w1,4w5).
correction:...because they have the ability to zone out and keep going.
what i meant is that they can do irritating stuff without getting stressed because they have the to zone out and keep going.

3667: 'EXTREME extrovert. Probably ESTP. Basically, 7w8 sx is the badass. 8w7 sx is the worseass. 3w4 sx is the diva. Combining them, you get someone with a VERY strong ego and high demands on the world.

Probably 4w5-9w1-p6w7 so/sp. You seem like a classic social 4. 469 seems likely, because you seem more 9ish than 1ish. 4w3s are more flashy and extroverted, so you're 4w5. There's a decent amount of...

I'm an extroverted ISTP. The only reason I don't type as ESTP is because my Ni is a bit stronger than my Fe.
Throwback! I am none of the types I most related to, and only 1 of the kindas. I'm actually 137.
Hi. 7w6 with a superiority complex.
I started out as 5w4-8w7-3w4 sp/so Now I'm cp6w7-8w7-3w4 sx/sp The interesting bit was in between (584, 684, 784, 714, 794, 793, 782, 783, 712, 713)
I'm usually around level 4, but as a 6, the descriptions push cp6 to level 6.
Then I should be a 1 and an 8, slowly moving towards 3. In fact, I'm a cp6.
This is about R&H's health levels. I've been at level 6 (whether I'm a 5 (unlikely), a 6, a 7 or an 8, or even a 4). Quernus - That's about Level 8. By Level 9, you can't even hate yourself any more.
Zack de la Rocha - cp6w7-8w7-4w5 or something. Definitely cp6-8-not 2. sx/so stacking.
INTPs are the least likely xNxP to be 4w3. But, it you're sure, a 4w3 INTP would use Ne and Fe to project an image of weirdness, but acceptable weirdness.
I'm a fan of sp-lasters. sx/sp can get too brooding and intense, but so/sx and sx/so can allow it out.
If you're saying talkative, then  ENTP ESFJ ENFP ENFJ ESFP ESTJ ESTP ISFJ
Weak, and always has been. 7w6sw8w7.
Yes, I know. But my normal heart fix is 4w5. Just 3 > 2 in heart.
This is a modification to the theory. Of course you can't do this in the original theory.    Read up on the sx 1.   Doesn't that sound like a 1w8 to you?  In this system, I'm 7w5-1w8-4w3.
Lust is about intensity. Gluttony is about variety. The sx instinct is also about intensity, but possibly without the external focus of lust and gluttony.
I'm a 6. It was mainly from the fact that I'd like to stop with my aggressive scepticism. But then the world will end.
I independently had this basic idea. I think the integration point is what you really want in life, but your main type holds you back For example, 6s want peace (like a healthy 9), but their...

A)  Type 9 - It's not okay to assert yourself. Type 1 - It's not okay to make mistakes. Type 3 - It's not okay to have your own feelings and identity. Type 2 - It's not okay to have your...
No, it can't. Both 6 and 5 are head types. Your gut fix has to be a gut type: 8, 9 or 1.
I would like to have my username changed to ENerdTP, because I'm an ENTP.
1w9 = ITJ 1w2 = ETJ 2w1 = FJ 2w3 = EFJ 3w2 = E 3w4 = ENT 4w3 = NF 4w5 = IF 5w4 = IN 5w6 = IT
1w9 - IxTJ 1w2 - xxxJ 2w1 - xxFJ 2w3 - ExFJ 3w2 - ENFJ 3w4 - xxTJ 4w3 - xxFx 4w5 - IxFx 5w4 - Ixxx 5w6 - IxTx
I'd be 6w5-8w6-5w7.
Ramsay Bolton is a disintegrated 2w3.

EXTREMELY strong 5 wing, strong enough that I typed as 5w4 instead of 6w5. (Not 5w6, because they are too emotionally repressed). My w7 is nowhere near as strong as my w5, but it is still there.

How old are you? I ask mostly because anywhere 20+ and finding a virgin is pretty rare.
People who insist their are two right sides to every argument. Nope, sometimes there's just one side with supporting facts.
Relax, it was just way too easy to pass up :)
A  really fun example is seeing when someone has asked the exact same question as one that's been asked a thousand times before just slightly rephrased ;)
Not really, if something has to get done I'll do it but strongwilled isn't really one of my better qualities
Oops I meant closer to Fi => ENFP but got distracted while typing :P, again not really conclusive but every ENTP I know and myself see life as shades of grey.   So yeah, I'd lean ENFP.
While not conclusive, that is more along the lines of Fi vs Ti
It comes down to Ti vs Fi. One good question is do you believe there is absolute right and wrong or is morality one big grey area?

MisterPerfect - I agree that they are both totally hot.  There's something about the mentally unstable that really turns me on.  Not sure what that says about me as a person.  :D  I might post...
MisterPerfect - Actually, no, I don't read comics.  I do, however, really enjoy characters and story arcs and reading in general.  So, I have read a lot of the DC and Marvel character's backstories. ...
I had my first a year and a half ago at 25.
SilentButDeadly - That's quite the lineage!  Had to look up the Cane Corso!  What a very powerful, intimidating dog!  Three kids!  Holy moly.  I can't even imagine at this juncture.  Our little man...
SilentButDeadly - Are you military now?  What kind of dog?  Ours is a German Shepherd/Lab mix.  Love her.  I considered shooting her while I was pregnant, though.  Fun fact, I don't own a gun!  :D
You're right!  We all do the best with what we know.  :)
I figured it out!  *spin*  I think the original file was corrupted, so I did a screenshot and edited to fit.  Perfection.
SilentButDeadly - My father was in the military until I was 3.  After that he was employed with a company that allowed him to be promoted if he moved to different startups throughout the U.S.  I've...
Hi!  Welcome!  Your energy excites mine.  Let's party.
Welcome!  Typing people you don't know is part of the fun!
Welcome!  I have tried lucid dreaming with a bit of success.
Welcome INTP!  I have three cats.  Nice to know you.
I do this same thing with cooking!  Sometimes it's incredible, though, so it's worth it.  Thanks for wasting your life with us!  Welcome.
New experiences are the shit!  Welcome.
Dude, I read your cya as cover your ass.  LoL.  Guess who's worked in an office too long.  Welcome!  Thanks for no longer lurking.
My hubby is an INFP!  You're in good company.  :)  There's nothing wrong with you!  Perhaps the type of job you're going for isn't working out because they suck or it's just not the right fit.  It...
UraniaIsis - Thanks!  I tried .jpg and .png uploaded from my computer as well as trying a URL.  I NEED MY AVATAR!  *weeps*    Jimmy - Thanks!  I think people who use too cool for school are also...
If you don't have super powers, we can't get along.  Nice to meet you!
I would disagree with this.  Some of the dolls, like Echo and Alpha, develop personalities.  They can draw from all of their previous imprints, but ultimately, they have created a personality for...
With any luck, you'll be the first one that likes me.  :P Thank you!
Hi everyone!  Someone linked me to this site and I found it interesting, so I decided to join!  Also, I need friends because everyone hates me.  :D    I am a bit put out because I can't get my...'"


3905: 'Getting up at 5am to watch Eurovision every May.
Se dominant, so ESFP.
Not necessarily.
Nah.   Adele was prob the best I've ever seen, and I'm not even her biggest fan.   Harry Styles new sound is much better than the sound of One Direction.   Would see Zeppelin, but not now even...
Been to Adele this year, Guns N' Roses, and going to Harry Styles in Nov. Hope to see the Stones again in Europe this year.
I've only seriously dated one person since I turned 18. It lasted a few months, I s'pose.   I'm 22 now.
22. At uni but finishing in 6 months.   My ideal night out is cancelling my night out and staying at home. Have my friends over, have drinks and food and binge watch a TV series or movies.  ...
Couldn't care less.   I'm not open about my political opinions, generally, because I'm not interested in getting into redundant debates with moral bandwagon-jumpers. They're not going to change my...
Well there you go.
Did I ask you to?
I've never experienced jealousy in a romantic sense.   I don't care enough about my relationships to feel jealousy. It's rare that I commit to a single person anyway; most of the time I've got a...
I treat it like any other day by dictating to everyone around me Kim Jong-un style.  But I claim all of January as my birthday. One day might be enough for the average Joe, but I'm worth more...
Because it's the closest to where I live.   People here don't move to other cities, much less states, very often to go to university. If you have a good one locally, that's where you go because it...
I don't have a problem with it as long as the person doing the complaining is also actively trying to change whatever they're complaining about. I can't stand people who whine but do nothing to fix...
Humans are animals too, in case you didn't realise.
I'll keep it to myself.
You must love me then. One word answers are my speciality. Keep them guessing is my motto.   :perc3:
If you struggle with high school, you won't cope at all with college/university.   As mean as it sounds, just get on with it. High school is relatively easy, and you're close to being finished....
ENTP.  I see Ti, not Fi.
Well, most people would assume I'm an ESFP if they didn't know me well, so. No help, soz.
The only one I've seen is Hidden Figures, and I liked it a lot, so I'd choose that by default.   La La Land and Lion both look dull as dishwater.
Peyton and Lucas are both ISFPs.  Brooke - ESFP in the earlier seasons, tending more towards ENFP in later seasons Hayley - ISFJ Rachel - ESTP Nathan - ISTP  Dan - ESTP Deb - ESFP Karen -...

Where did you study? Sydney, AU.  What did you study? Started out in Law, transferred to Global Business, transferred again to Business. Will finish at the end of this year. The university wants...
I have no problem with Sensors, including ESTPs. All of my closest friends are Sensing types.   My biggest issue is with the Ni-dominant types.
Niles Crane from Frasier or Niles from The Nanny. Must be something in the name.   Also, Holtzmann from the recent Ghostbusters movie.   And Jack Sparrow.
I'm in my final year of a BBA and have not covered any of the issues you've listed. Business textbooks generally stick to the curriculum, which don't really apply to the actual realities of running a...
Trump is definitely more self-destructive than Putin.   But neither of them are a real concerned. It's just fear-mongering.
I abhor the idea of commitment; even moreso the reality.
Youngest of 3. Don't know my enneagram.   Simultaneously the most ambitious of the three, and the least likely to reach their potential.    May not be an ENTP, tbh.
Not sure you've thought this through entirely...  Do you understand how long it takes to get to judge status? The different levels of judges? The fact that you'll be earning a pittance for 10+...
I only truly love two people: my mum and my dog.  But that's neither typical nor atypical for a thinking type. Everyone's different. Thinking doesn't mean unfeeling.
My mother's Russian and in 21 years I've still not learnt the language. Can understand it, and can read it, but can't speak it.   It's also useless unless you plan on living or working in Russia.
ENTP.  Want at least one child (may end up only having one because I'm prone to favouritism), but couldn't care less about marriage. Don't want kids until I'm 30+ though.
Well, there are a lot of jobs that you can't do without a degree, and a lot of companies which won't consider you at all unless you have a degree (even for an entry level, menial job), so, in that...
There's no we. This doesn't involve you. It involves him, his ex and their child. If she doesn't want to follow the court order, that's something he needs to deal with.   I would suggest,...
Not sure why making a thread about this was necessary, prob could've been said through PM.  :rollseyes:
Separate.  Unless they're loaded. In that case, joint.
1. I want results. When I think about an idea, I want to put it to action and not think about multiple idea. Sure at first I might, but I will settle for one and try to run with it and see where it...
1) What is your Meyers Briggs type?  ENTP  2) What do you to to unwind/relax?  Binge watch PLL on Netflix, make my best friend who's in love with me spend time with me/buy me food, hang out...
Nah.   I'm fine being on my own but prefer being with other people. I've never struggled socially.
Nope. Atheist.
There are a lot of sensitive snowflakes in the ENTP threads, so I wouldn't say ENTPs.  Probably Ti-doms. ISTP and INTP.
Not an asshole, just not particularly bright.   Nothing wrong with not wanting children, but there are flaws in your reasoning. The evolution of our descendants and common ancestors  resulting in...
I don't think Page is an Ne user. Plant, however, is.  I don't hear the Se sound. As someone else said, ACDC is very ESTP, as is GNR.
Too much Ne in their lyrics.
I'm an ENTP.  My mum tested as an INFP, but I think she's probably an ENFP.  My dad was an ENTP.  Sister 1 is an ESFJ, and sister 2 is probably an ISTP.  Maternal grandmother is probably an...
They likely aren't much rarer than any other type. They're probably mistyped by a lot of people, however.   People who only know me on a casual/acquaintance level would likely assume I'm an ESFP. ...

She said no. Said it was too limiting lol (basically same thing she said to me after reading the 4w3 thread).
Yeah that makes sense but the INFP I know (this is from experience only of course) seem not to be so confident.   No, she is not always aware of her surroundings. Me, ENFP friend and her take turns...

since you've put the <3 for the INFP I would say you're an IxTJ alright :laughing: for some reason you guys have a thing for Fi dominant people specially INTJs so I would go ahead and say yes
Hmm by leaders I meant political ones like presidents or military generals

Don't know why but I always liked ISTPs Kay is an ISTP while Kyo is an ESTP that's why I prefer Kay his personality of generally not giving a damn is just awesome
from what I've seen which is not much I would say yes you're an INFP alright
From what I know Ti despises being ordered around while Te is basically bossiness so shouldn't the two clash with each other instead of being compatible

I'm also a strong economic libertarian but I believe social issues have a strong place in Keeping The Peace and lean strongly progressive when it comes to them.
I got into Gaiman after reading Good Omens, actually. I reckon that ENTPs can especially appreciate both authors because we are so fond of clever wordplay.  I've never read Jim Butcher actually.

If I need special glasses to see their beauty it's not beauty anymore

I am talking cake
You can be a source of entertainment for a few hours
Cake sucks.
Hello, guys
Hello
I'll have one, thank you.  *Drinks it greedily*
Man, nobody cares about us today
Let's hope ENFP's like us more than ENFJ's *wipes tear*
What's the point of invading if there's nothing to invade?
They may simply not be interested  Let's return to our true lovers, the INFJ's :unsure:
Where do you find all these photo's? Do you have 'em saved up for the perfect occasion?
Is that a filter or what? The photo looks weird as hell
And so, it begins.
Hello! I hope you have a nice time here.
Alright, going to sleep, I have a schedule to respect (unfortunately). Have a great time!
If someone witnesses face to face to you that they have a crush on you, how do you react?
Sounds reasonable :P
Hello! Glad to see another ENTP joining our ranks :)
Yeah, it is.  What are your biggest fears? I'm afraid of being irrelevant. I'm afraid of living a boring life with a 9 to 5 job. I'm afraid of being just another nobody. I want to leave my mark on...
Well, it may help you, since you're introverted. However, if I do that, I become quite sad and miserable. I hate recognizing it, but this routine of debating and talking with the people I interact...
Oh, I think I've misunderstood your affirmation.  I agree. Too many douchebags and too many bitchy girls for my liking IRL. Makes me feel intellectually unsatisfied.
Don't take us too seriously. If I'm not wrong, you do tend to do that kind of thing ;)  Yes, these jokes are cheesy. Yes, this thread is weird. That doesn't mean we're douche bags.
Welp, sorry for redirecting the purpose of the thread  Have a great night, everyone
That's what happens when you're surrounded by shallow, dumb people.  I wish I met someone in real life who thinks as I do. It's too bad it's not gonna happen very soon.
If only all the girls had the same opinion as you, I would get all the ladies  But, most of the ones I know are interested in shallow boys they like only because they're douchebags  Oh, well
Well, not all invasions last forever
Did the INFJ invasion die? :(
Yeah, he is an ENTP  Hot, though? In an unconventional way, I guess.
They don't exist, really
Oh, so it's basically a thread where all the types socialize? sounds kinda cool
What is that event all about?
Not kinky enough for some of us
Will take that into consideration
It's still going :)
We're invading your thread to seduce you and you ignore us and turn your attention on another INFJ? Heretic!
Everybody is big and tough on the Internet
The only issue with that is that you're too shy to try to seduce any sorts of extroverted
Well, they are quite rare
It's not a sausage fest as long as we have the INFJ women on the other side
I'm back to serve (maybe this time I'll actually get the ladies)
Oh, alright.
Do we invade anybody today?
Our lust is insatiable. Must...have...more...invasi-  *blacks out*
Thank the both of you for stroking our massive ego's.
Makes sense.
Man, you surely like talking.  It's hard to get a INFJ out of their shell, but, if you manage to do that, they'll talk with you for days, it seems.  It looked fun. A pity I had to go to sleep to..."

ESTJ spouse x 5 years (almost). He's a guy who really knows where his towel is, if you know what I mean.
Is this game even for real? I have a suspicion, as others have mentioned, that it is an invention of the insecure, or of people who don't actually want to go on dates.   I feel like you should...
One of the good things about working with SJs, is you can foist a lot of that boring stuff off on them, and reciprocate by scooping up responsibility for that tasks that they hate but aren't so bad...
Ok so I think you are looking at this backwards. It sounds to me from your post that you have mostly enjoyed your course work and internships, but have some lingering doubts as it grows closer to...
Geonerd  I feel like we are basically saying the same thing with the 2 weeks being potentially ambiguous. It is perhaps hard for me to look back as a married-for-years-now person (as I know you...
Yes and no. It's more that I would not consider dating for two weeks to make a person my boyfriend. And I wouldn't consider dating someone else at that point to be cheating. But I wouldn't pretend...
I agree with the late bloomer consensus. High school was certainly not my glory days. College/grad school was better- I had far better luck with friends when I actually chose them based on shared...
There is just absolutely no way I would even remotely commit to another person after 2 weeks of dating. I don't even consider that really dating. Just... going on dates. But I always insisted that I...
Absolutely avoidance. And if I'm stuck with the person, maybe try to distract them. Or make myself unavailable (e.g.headphones) or extremely dull so they'll leave.
I've always kind of thought I was all 16 types simultaneously. Maybe we're like... divergent.
Nah, Bella can have him. Necro's a hard limit for me.
I am a pharmacist and I know a lot of physicians, as well as PAs and NPs, both personally and professionally. I have not noticed a particular tendency for them to be NTs. I would say all the SJ types...
It is so hard to go from riding high and feeling like you rule the world, to suddenly feel like you've fallen off a cliff and left your climbing equipment at the top. I know I personally was used to...
I shun all collars in favor of athleisure wear.
I had a lot of similar miscommunication issues with my ESTJ husband back when we were first dating, so here's my two cents as far is your situation is concerned. Being in a relationship with a Te dom...
All sea creature-human love contained in this novel is totally consensual. And we're led to believe that the colonel's tentacles are strangely alluring to young Marianne.
I also like when guys don't try to hard to please me. Like, don't be a suck up or say what you think I want to hear. And don't be too available to be at my beck and call all the time.
It sounds like you two have been essentially dating for a while, it just was not acknowledged by either of you. Now you can just carry on- but also make out. As long as you carry on treating one...
A few scenarios to consider:  1. What if the beast is the initiator?  Everyone knows dolphins like to drag ppl down to their rape caves and have their way under the sea.   2. Some animals can be...

The only things I can think of are way way TMI, so I guess you can just imagine them.
373634  I was hanging around some of JKR's old haunts a couple weeks ago... but sadly she didn't show.
More tequila will solve that problem. Ugly, shmugly!
I can't imagine any parent ever telling a young girl to always agree with her boyfriend. OMG. Thanks, M&D for telling me to use my own brain.
I like to re-friend my enemies when they get engaged and start planning expensive weddings so I score an invite. Then I drink all their tequila and dance with the groom.
I have always thought that I was far lower-maintainence than most other women I know, in family/friend relationships as well as intimate relationships. A lot of people I know do things that I find to...
I'm not really a frequent flier on this forum, but I'll chime in with the crowd and say that I don't mind at all when other types post here. Visit away! Especially if you tell us you <3 us.
Jamaia; Geonerd Thanks for the encouragement, ladies. Most of my friends who have children have small babies and tots and it can be rather dizzying to observe all the appointments and paraphernalia...
This gave me a minor panic attack. I don't think I have it in me to organize to this level. I am impressed and will note your coping mechanisms in case I ever reproduce. How possible do you think it...
I can double down on this, though I wouldn't say I hate women (I'm sure you don't either). I find both friendships and casual conversations to be generally easier and more satisfying with men or...
This is amazing b/c it is precisely equal an opposite to my own experiences.  I think that Ne and Te are functions in which strong users of one have a very, very, hard time instinctively...
In what units is this Te measured???  I can take a fair amount from my Te-dom spouse, but there are other high Te users in my life who are more choking presences. So, highly variable based on...
I've never really felt like I was mom material per se. Nurturing, kindness, patience, etc does not come naturally to me. Also I really like sleep. However my husband wants children with all the...
Maybe you should do the opposite of living together without getting married: you could get married without living together! Or at very least keep separate bedrooms/territories (like in Downton Abbey)...
That is interesting b/c I always felt in school that I had an advantage over many of the other (probably SJ) pharmacy students b/c while they were busy memorizing things that anyone could easily just...
Interesting b/c ENTJ is one of the types I feel I have the least in common with and find little to personally identify with in descriptions. The couple ENTJs I know IRL are not people who I think of...

Why would you say/believe so? Anything in particular that STs have that NTs don't which makes them least likely? Just curious. Don't tell me it's the 'S' we don't have!
I am tempted to say yes because no problem can live with me for long - I am really harmful to harm.   But to be honest, I think it has more to do with multiple other factors and not just one's...

It wasn't a relationship issue that I was pondering (and beating around the bush) about. LOL! In those cases, I used to be pretty straightforward and blunt because I thought that was the simplest way...
Someone I was close with? Not trying to sound like the cliched ENTP, but I guess this curiousity is one reason i was close to him?  I actually wanted to discuss it all with that fellow (he's an...

Sounds cute, man! :)

No, but I wouldn't have said it after a week!
Normally, yes. But I accidentally said it whilst drunk. After about a week. To an INTJ. The silence that followed felt about ten years long. I was like 'oh shit, so that's the end of that then'. I...
Those guys need to stay off drugs, if you ask me!
You guys know there's a whole sub-forum for this? :playful:
So fed up with trying to organise anything with my friends right now, I'm considering giving up people & becoming an introvert. It's like herding cats!
That too. Usually Tumblr!
Also, this 1 billion times over!
I'd say it's easier to be ENTJ, if only for the fact that your working life is probably a hell of a lot smoother. Most of my past employers & colleagues back in the UK seem to see NT personality in...
Sorry for the double post. Stupid broadband issues.
I always fall for INTJ men. Usually because they're the only ones who can handle a pain-in-the-arse like me! :love_heart:  I'm married to one & looking back, although my marriage pre-dates the rise...
My INTJ usually likes to sit back & laugh at the results of my 'random button pushing'. Probably because he's already mapped out in his head exactly how people are going to react & is enjoying being...
Well said! Although if I wanted to be incredibly cynical, I could say that marriage was probably more 'logical' for him (INTJ), since I'm from the more affluent background... :rolling:
I actually have the same thing. Very annoying when you pick up on something straight away & then have to wait around for all your friends to catch up, especially if they happen to think the other...
Definitely not. He got something like an 80% N result.
Mainly STJs, especially ESTJs. One of my closest friends is ESTJ. He can never accept when he is in the wrong & will storm off when out-voted or out-thought. He's very hot-headed & also usually the...
I think they'd survive a long time, but knowing my ST friends, they would eventually do something rash (like storm off after an argument with the group) & get themselves turned into zombie food.
I think in the event of the zombie apocalypse, it would be pretty much just the NTs left standing. Cool heads & a logical approach to the problem will prevail over emotional responses. Personally,...

There do seem to be rather a high proportion of us girls with INTJ partners. I wonder what it is about this particular combination?
I enjoy swearing in fucking general! If someone gets offended, it usually just makes me do it more, until they fuck off. :victorious:

ESTJs for conflict (starting arguments etc), ESFJs for drama (getting easily upset, gossiping etc). Just in my personal experience. I love my ESFJ friend to death, but she cries about five times a...
I'm ENTP & have never been placed in anything other than Slytherin (hence my avatar). Last time I took a quiz that gave a breakdown, I got SGRH.
I'd give up the F. I have a reasonably well-developed S side, so I'd cope better that way. Plus, almost all my closest friends are T users. I don't think I'd fit in very well with them if I lost my T.
Love the Hitchhiker's quote there.

Around southeast Asia for certain!

INFJ has to be the hardest type for me. As an ENTP, I tend to find them too needy & they tend to be way too easily offended. I always try to get along with everyone, but I'm not willing to sensor...

It's weird, because we have an ESFJ friend who, whilst being extremely loveable, is easily the least intelligent of the group & he gets on fantastically with her. Of course, part of the appeal is...

Guys I think I am totally hopeless. I mean seriously during the course of a couple of weeks I´ve changed my mind. Why you might ask?. Well, I watched alot of mbti videos (about the functions...
Hi again! You shall not post in the thread I've sent you! In that thread you will find 20 questions that you can answer in THIS thread so that you may get advice about your type. Hi Hermione G!...
Hi! I see that you have tried to study the MBTI. You know what, the test is not the whole reality of the MBTI? The MBTI is founded upon the idea of psychological types that originated with Carl...
I were actually serious about the ENFP thing. I strongly believe I'm an Ne dom or auxillary so I don't think I am an SFJ. I also do not exhibit some of the charecteristics of Fe so if I had Fe it...
Thanks man! I felt something was wrong... Then ENFP it is!
Yeah, I've been pondering this alot. Te vs Ti in the Ne dominant types is a tough question (considering feeling ans thinking being adjacent in the function stack). Ti is experience based. That means...
I don´t know about you´re Te though . If you were an ENFP you would have Te as you´re tertiary function. I cannot give you anything that indicates this(except for you´re test results) (so you could...
exactly there are not “activities” that energize me, is only the possibility of the activity,  what drain me is the activity in itself, the crash with reality, and especially with time: deadlines...
Thank you
Yeah, I just thought you gave such wonderful examples of Ne dominance in the links you gave me, so I thought you could gave me links on Ni dominance. I know some of the definitions of Ni since way...
From this I can really only conclude the presence of Ne and Fi. However Fi seems to have a more dominant grip on you. Q9 b) could be an indication of inferior Te, but also it could be a sign of being...
Thanks for your answer! It really helped clear up some things. I´m sorry if my answers were a little short (I´m not as introspective as I should be).
You welcome!
1) What aspect of your personality made you unsure of your type? The fact that I am a quite sensitive person although I am still a quite logical individual just messes with my mind. That´s the...
Yeah, I´ll do that. It would be helpful if you could come back when I´ve filled out the questionnaire.
I agree with former post. I can´t see you as anything else than an Ne user and so in order for you to have Fe you would have to be an ENTP with a highly developed Fe (which for the record is the...
Thanks for claryfing your position!  I´m just curious as to why you in the first place said that Q4 to 6 is something someone with a high preferance for Thinking wouldn´t write if the answer on Q5...
I should probably not get involved in this again but I would like to contribute. You could still be an Ne dom and consider your emotionalism and respect towards other people (etc) I would think it to...
Hi! Your results on the tests are pretty non-conclusive which forces me to ask you to answer some questions. Answer the 20 questions present in this thread:...
Hi! When you started speaking about respecting others perspectives I thought, Ne LOL. But the more I read about you the more Fe you were shining through. I don´t know so very much about Ni (as it´s...
It is definitely something which would further confirm your type and the E-I issue could be answered through it. My advice would be to post it
As a comment to your former post, I want to say that having a fear of other judging you or having a fear of being unliked could well indicate inferior Fe in you (it sure doesn't indicate Fi who...
I hope all that makes sense.  PS: you looking moody or depressed could be your Ti shining through into your external appearence (Ti is very impersonal and logical).
From this I can conclude that you probably use Ti and you seem to show inferior Fe. Therefore I believe you are an INTP. A love of language could be a sign of Ti (Ti loves defining words and finding...
I'm from Sweeeden by the way so you might see some spelling mistakes sometimes in my posts. The fact that I currently am writing this on my phone further complicates the issue

I changed the post before this one, I relate more to the ENTP not to the INTP
Thanks man for answering the questions before the big question! From your answers I can relate more to the ENTP more than the INTP, the thing about how they recieve feedback in particular.
You do a good job writing down your thoughts. I have heard that Italian in general are not very skilled in speaking/writing english. So Bravo!
It becomes pretty clear in light of that test that you are indeed an NFP. I don't howerver trust test that much considering me getting diffrent results on diffrent tests. Cognitive functions tests...
Yeah, fantastic!  We Ne users can feel alot of doubt regarding our type stemming from our perception of possibilities. It is much easier for the Ni using types to discover their type, in my opinion...
I do adap my behaviour depending on my envirnoment. Sometimes I mimic the style of speech that the other people around me uses (I mean style of speaking). So yeah, then I can feel confident that I am...
Great! Are you confident about which type you are?
Hi again! I apologize for my indecision (Ne driving me freaking crazy)?. I wonder about what you guys think of Ti vs Fi in me. Again I am veryyy indecisive and secondguessing is like something I do...
I'm actually 15 this august
I'm an 14 yeaoe old ENTP and stil being raised in a home with an ESFJ mother has greatly developed my Fe. That's why I talked about it as a possibility but it's quite rare that's such a thing happens.
I read some of your former posts. You seemed to feel more at home with INFPs than ISTPs. This could be the shared Ne. You secondguessing yourself is also a sign of Ne (seeing all the possibilities...
Hi there! You have a clear presence of Ne (seeing things from diffrent angles, saying random things etc). I don't get as much of wibe about your judging function (Fi or Ti). Some of what you have...
After further conaideration I'm pretty confident you're an INFP or ENFP. You do seem to use Te alot more than what you would excpect from the typical INFP (considering that's their inferior), but at...
The you don't notice what's around you is a clear lack of Se. Se notices all the little details in the immediate environment. But I think besides that there is quite alot to suggest you use Ne not...
Correction: Fi wants to hide their emotions from other people
Still I don't get an overly touchy feely wibe about you (could be due to Fi not wanting to hide their emotions). What you wrote about you not liking illogical people is a very INTP/ENTP/All Te doms...
The thing where you process thing out loud suggests a presence of Te (Te processes information out loud). You do seem to do it occasionally which further suggests INFP.
I would agree that there is presence of Fi but I see it more in a presence of Te. I may have innacurately typed you on that front but Ne is pretty clear"

Haven't watched TV in years, it doesn't appeal to me at all. Music is something else though, I never go anywhere without it. Couldn't pick one artist though, I think. If I absolutely had to, I'd...
Hello and welcome to PerC! I am new here myself and so far I like it a lot. I'm fairly confident in saying you are going to enjoy it here!
You see this is precisely the thing I needed to know. Usually when he is down and he talks badly about himself I usually do just what you advice me not to, I don't agree with him (because you know, I...

I realize that this will differ from person to person, I am speaking in general terms. But there has to be some stuff that is more or less true for most ISFPs.  The reason I am asking is that I'm...
Yes I agree it is good practice indeed. I just find that usually when I read about stuff my brain tend to move quite quickly. I forget about the details of things. It's almost as if I can see the...
I am sitting here pondering wether or not I should try and catch some sleep. My body says yes and my mind clearly states no. What a predicament.

Definitely not.  Entps are the more likely of the two to debate.  An intp might actually be pretty uncomfortable with the potential reactive emotional outburst.
You don't actually have to answer-but entps are known to be showy but private - so pee with the door open (in a public bathroom) but no one knowing that they got divorced....
Most don't use the fe. No it isn't necessary - fe is a value judgement and entps aren't renowned for values... Or boundarys... Do you pee with the door opened or closed?
Theories only change the world when they make it out of your mind into implementation.  Otherwise it is just bullshit that you thought of to keep yourself occupied....  BS much?
I did. It is great, except when something small needs to be done, that COULD take 5 minutes, but instead takes 3 hours (or weeks) of debate first (like changing a diaper, or planting the tree in the...
And how would we cheat - by hiding an NF under our desks?
Yes. But typically friends are people who don't bore... People in general - headache time.
@jdstankosky - the real difference between INTP and ENTP is that the order for ENTP is Ne Ti Fe Si, and the function order for INTP is Ti Ne Si Fe... @Basileus That means that INTP and ENTP actually...

But the evidence is out there that NTs actually score the highest out of all the subgroups on IQ tests.  NTs have higher IQs - but this doesn't necessarily mean they are inherently more intelligent...
Actually, the more INTP a person is, or is able to fake (even without BEING an INTP) - the higher on an IQ test one is likely to score.  IQ measures intelligence, and that measure is actually...
okay, I am convinced on Cersei...
You have some points - but I do have to argue that knowing or not knowing terms isn't the same as playing 4 or 5 plays ahead in a cat and mouse game...
And, regarding Dany... I don't see how she could be Fi.  Fe is the Charismatic Leader hallmark. She is definitely that.  If she is a P she would need to be a T in order to have Fe.  Unless...
I would actually strongly argue that Cersei is an N-type.  A hallmark of N-typing is thinking past one or two plays in a strategy game (Future thinking).  She very much outmaneuvers Ned Stark,...

My dad belongs to the ESFJ group and mom is an ISFP, and they get along well, probably because both are feelers.

Even criticism flatter us ;D
You know she is an ENTP when she takes your criticism as a compliment ;)
Well, people love seeing our reaction when they criticize us.  They love it. So they come again and again and post there for more pleasure. They love us, like they hate us ;)
Hmm, I being an intuitive also get along with my ESFJ friend, even after that huge gap of Ne-Ti-Fe-Si and Fe-Si-Ne-Ti. Many of her traits also doesn't at all match with the ESFJ description. But...
Yep, I said that because you all said that you're no less than a N, at first my point was when you people know your strengths then why pay attention to what others have to say? The more complex you...
Nope. I never said that being misunderstood makes one an intuitive. That's not what I actually meant, I was talking about the problems which many intuitive face irl because of behaving in ways which...
Well, you can't really blame the intuitives for calling you all that in a negative way here, cause they always get ignored and neglected by sensors in real life, and irl, sensors don't actually care...
This can be a Se trait too, I've seen ESFPs correcting and laughing at others when they mispronounce a word or something.
Nope. We'll are not fishes. Some of us are birds, and tigers, who have their strength in the sky and in the land. ;)

Yeah, I feel the same. My sister is also an ENTP, so I've her, but she doesn't live with me now. So, it feels good to post here.

Jen, the campaign manager for Bobby Newport in Season 4, is an ENTP. I think she's hilarious. Bobby Newport is an ESFP.

I disagree. Everything is connected. When typing, you look holistically at a person to see overarching trends. Personality is connected and related to the words you use, the ideas you have and the...
Elle is ESFJ. That is not the walk of a perceiver.

I would say George is INTJ and Charlie is ENFP. Is Kenny the student? If so I'd say ISFP.
Well you're a really strong P that's for sure. You don't talk much about E/I tendencies. Do you feel energized or taxed by parties/big groups? Would you rather read about something or discuss it? Do...
ENFPs are by far the easiest to manipulate. They crave acceptance and wear their insecurities on their sleeves. Sorry ENFPs :)

How so? He does remind me more of the enfps than the esfps I know, but I'd still say he's closer to esfp than entp.
Well, ExxP seems pretty obvious but I see nothing N about him. Secondly, he has a woman who's much, much hotter than him. So that leaves us with ESFP.  I didn't watch much though.

INFJs are just much better versions of ISFJs for ENTPs. INFJs will get us, while having the good, sweet qualities of an ISFJ.
I think for the sake of understanding, the word serious needs to be defined further.
Good thread. Most people post about overly sensitive people but to me it's the overly serious people that are more annoying and obstructionist to our ways.
If you're not attracted to the INFJ then let her go. But if you find a stunningly beautiful INFJ then you should keep that one.. That's the golden ticket right there for ENTPs.
We wouldn't lead by brute force, but by sheer manipulation (for good or bad) and charisma. And we'd also influence things from the background. Kind of like valuable advisers to the main ESTJ/ENTJ...

Tosh is not an ENTP. What makes you think he's an ENTP?
Enlighten me.
You sure you're an ENTP? ENTPs definitely live inside their own head so they at least need some downtime.
How can you possibly get bored if you're an ENTP? Go learn something and apply your skills.
Workout and get really tired.
Having an invisible jaw is so mysterious.
So does this mean it's illogical to identify a frog specimen as either male or female? Both humans and frogs are animals, so why should the former be excluded from such classification?
Then how do you identify yourself? I mean, you are something. Might as well be male--if you are male.

He doesn't really sound like an ESTP.. They generally don't take an interest in D&D and asking opinions on things. I could be wrong though.

They're nice I guess.  But from my experience they tend to be needy.  They ask you to do things for them and then they thank you so much.  It's annoying.  I don't think I could ever date an INFP...

It says I'm most likely a type 9, but with the wing it would be 7w6.  Looking at both type 7 and 9, I feel like I would be a little more 7 then 9, but I am almost 50% both.  Combine 7 and 9 and you...
I find it odd that ENFPs use Te and ENTPs use Fe.  So if someone's more of an asshole to you then they're F (in this case) and if they're more passive about it they're T (in this case).
Pretty much this, though I want to add a few things.  I always try to keep myself psycho analyzed, and while it's great for awareness, it can also make you have some psychopathic tendencies if not...
I agree, but I understand it in a logical way more than I actually feel it.  I think it's very important for humans to have internal values.  Read 1984 or Brave New World or read up on...

I'm going with INTJ.  My INTP friends are more likely to have dinner with friends, but the INTJs I know are taxed by a phone call when there's something else they want to be working on, which is...
Heck, I'm going to thank you just for giving me that image.
Yes.  They're not all eunuchs.  Some of them are complete freaks and I'm okay with that.
I'd hit that everyday and make him like it.
I have a tendency to befriend ISTJ women and the only time I have a problem with them is when I tip too much.
That's a valuable bit of wisdom, actually.  Thinkers are harder to impress.
A crush. A road trip or vacation. A story idea.
That's in, like, direct opposition to an ENTP.  At the end of the day I make sure to have sex so I can forget about all the stuff I don't want to have to do.

Mostly I prefer spending time in company. Whenever I stay at home (alone) longer than a day, I feel nervous, insecure, lonely... I feel like I need to discuss/share various stuff all the time ._.

Yeppers, since I have started discovering my sexuality. I thought it would change with more frequent sexual intercourse but I had been wrong.
People already think of me this way which compliments me alot. I am impressed because sometimes I need just a short weird sentence or reaction and they freak out. I love when they do it. :D

I never said it was easy.
Heh.  I get it, trust me. I just don't get why everyone's panties are in such a bunch about it.  The fact that an ENTP made this thread is even more confusing.
You hate people who want to be or think themselves to be special...  You need to get a life.
Chill.  It seems like he wants you to over think this if he won't give you a direct answer. OR he's just way too nosy without realizing, like I tend to. Or he wants your penis. Or... it could...
I break down everything I think about until it can't be broken down anymore.  Everything.
I realized I wasn't an INTP because I was not shy about my accomplishments in any way shape or form and I wasn't quite as angry as a lot of INTPs were.

Maybe the reason for being indecisive is an strongly developed FE.
I haven't considered this yet, mostly because it's was unconscious, i just figured it out now, when i was trying to know why i'm so indecisive. But now that i know it, i'll try to control.
Yes, that's my problem, i see so many possibilities that i freeze and start analyzing everyone, and i can't satisfy myself while i don't find the perfect choice.

Hi, OP is back. I just saw your post after reading the chain of new ones preceding it, and if you look at my most recent responses, you'll see that I answered your question recently, in response to...
A question can not be valid or invalid, as they do not have truth values. It is only statements which attempt to answer questions which can be either, so your nice little rant was a waste of time.
So do you mean to tell me that we can not be sure that 2+2=4 due to a lack of absolute knowledge of all things?
Fallacy of equivocation. The way in which you use God here is different from the way in which I intended. Allow me to clarify: A creator of the universe.
What is it that leads you to be so sure you can't know? Curious on your thought process.
I'm sure there's some degree of merit to NLP, but your repeated displays of spite towards anyone who disagrees are not helping you convince anyone of that!

Careful, you might be sounding a little too typist for their liking. Also, out there- just taken. By a girl. lol.
You're welcome to argue with yourself if you'd like, though. That goes for anyone else who got offended.
Or maybe people just shouldn't be triggered by different opinions. We have control of our actions. I'm tired of this discussion, though.
Ah, well. It's a good thing that I have yet to meet such people, if they do exist. Yet something tells me you assumed I made those broad assumptions despite that I said nothing of the sort. Oh well.
I realized that high-functioning cognition=intelligence, but refrained from saying it lest I be berated more for being pretentious. Ahh I see what you meant, thanks for clarifying.
Ohh you meant generalizations about each type, such as the one I made regarding depth of thought, correct?
I actually agree with you and thank you for providing this insight. I only said it in one post but I actually apologized for my initial wording at one point in how I used the term shallow, but it was...
Most people don't like to consider the possibility that they might be wrong. That's why they stay wrong, more often than not. I am not afraid of being wrong, because I know that I can never be right...
You're right that a lot of premises are missing. That's because they're implied. How does value imply meaning? The answer is tautological: it's in the definition of value.
If people have intrinsic value, then at least one thing in this universe has meaning. In order for something to have meaning, it's true that it has to be assigned by an outside entity. So, the only...

Thank you guys for helping me so far! Right now I'm really leaning towards INFP or ISFP :)

I don't know why people care so much, your 'type' success or failure statistics reflect nothing on you, at the end of the day you're an individual. If you want a high paying job, go get it.

Yep, pretty much as soon as external stimulation is reduced it's BAM! daydream time. So yeah, we're not crazy! ^.^
We do love a challenge! :wink:
From my own experiences - and the replies to this thread - I'm pretty sure it's a common thing for ENTPs. I also tend to reflect upon past, present or potential future situations and play them out in...
Very good point, and as proof that our topics of interest aren't always concrete, I enjoy studying philosophy (with logic and objectivity, obviously) and I have an INFP buddy who loves the sciences. ...
Heh, that happens sometimes... :unsure: To be fair, dogs are magnificent creatures! :proud:
I got ENTP: E=68% N=100% T=70& P=100%.
What do you mean there is no plan!?
ding, ding, ding we have a winner!
My apologies if there's been a similar thread created previously, but I was curious as to whether there are any themes regarding ENTP morals and how we justify our actions. Obviously, we won't all...
You do realise that there's a difference between arguing with people and making yourself look like a complete tit, right?
Funny, most ENFPs I know understand that we are lacking in the department of agreeing with people, especially with incompetent people, such as yourself.  Good day. :wink:
Hello INFJ and welcome, however I believe you have us misconstrued. If you're looking for a site with discussions and debates, then I'm afraid you're out of luck - we're all really boring and hate...
Rooting for some TMV fans here! If there are, what're your favourite songs/albums by them? :D  Mine are: Songs -Goliath -Ilyena -Soothsayer -Vermicide -L'Via L'Viaquez -Eriatarka
Yeah, I have the same. It's really interesting actually, although it can get quite annoying when most/all of your friends are over emotional.
I myself enjoy multigenre music that manifests itself with lots of elements of rock, punk or metal, crossed with other genres such as jazz, electronica, country and salsa.  Also, for a band to be...
I drift a lot. I 'get on' fairly okay with most people, but I usually get bored of them fairly quickly, or they find me very intense - usually both!   I used to never really have a specific group...
It wouldn't matter if we all sucked or if ENTJs were the shit and the rest of us were just shit, it doesn't make the differences any less interesting. :p'"

I have given some thought to it... I still don't know. He is a IxxP, either feelings or thinking inferior, it is hard to tell which. And I don't know if he is N or S, probably S.
He doesn't naturally use Ti. It is something he learned to do because he isn't normal. Anytime you hear him speaking thoughts internally, that is Ti, and you hear it a lot in the show. He is supposed...

Superiority comes easy after spending time with an ISTJ.   Candy > baby.

MBTI doesn't, which is probably the biggest factor it doesn't account for in attraction.
For all those who make claims that some types are better/lesser than others, you don't understand MBTI at all. :P Myers called her book Gifts Differing for a reason.

My thing is that anytime I've been in that headspace, the only bullshit I hear people spout is call a hotline which is usually short for I don't want to talk to you about it, call someone who...
Ee in tee pee
Pretty hopeless tbh. I'm getting sick of everything and don't really see any reliably useful path forward. I can't stagnate forever but there's no forward I can reliably see.
Because whether they actually are or arn't, no one intends to call a hotline. If you're not, you don't actually need help so you'd not call, if you legitimately were, why call a place to try to talk...
Either one depending on the rest? I don't really think I have a preference. The eyes though...blue or green.
Stop telling suicidal people to 'call a hotline'. If they're actually suicidal, they either want someone other than a bullshit phone representative to try to help them (because nice words can't...

I'm extremely upset by how discriminatory you're being right now. Why would you purposely exclude other types, even as a joke? You know they don't have the emotional stability to handle that kind of...

No, you stated your opinion that you can't, it's a value-based judgement so there's not a logical way to prove which one is 'right'. Different moral values would yield different responses to that...
I believe that falls into an ethics argument on: If you mislead someone and something bad occurs because of it, does whether you intended it define if you did something wrong?

Here's a response I got back. He really took the entire conversation very seriously.
When you post this gem in another forum and people actually take it seriously and have actual discussion on the issue. :shocked: I'm both amused and mortified for the future of the human species.

Sometimes, if I'm realllllly tired, Si shows up for a little while. Otherwise, it's practically nonexistent.
