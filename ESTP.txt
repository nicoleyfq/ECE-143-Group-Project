I often come off to people with the opposite of my intention, if I don't listen to my gut. Sometimes I over think my natural social skills and come off as a sarcastic douche. Listening to your...

Since the I is non-negotiable, I would probably say ISFJ.  I think I get along quite well with the ones I know irl.  ISTP would probably be good as well.

ESTP and I like... good question tbh.  Some anime I really like include:  Bungou Stray Dogs Natsume Yuujinchou Servamp Yuri on Ice Aoharu x Kikanjuu Osomatsu-san
Hello, nice to meet you and welcome to the forum!!
Hello and welcome to the forum! It's nice to meet you!
Eight to nine hours. I make sure I go to bed early, too.
You're my favorite person on this website
ESTP with a mystery gender.  Most attracted to: INTJ, ISTJ Least attracted to: INFP, ENTP, INTP
ESTP. I love sunshine, no clouds. My favorite time of day is late morning to noon. I like cooler temperatures, too.
Depends on how you look at it. If you go into a speech or presentation with a negative attitude, then it's not going to get any easier. I've taken the class Public Speaking, where we presented...

She did a good thing that day. Tell her she did well.
That is probably the most edgy comeback I've ever heard from an ENFP. You ok there, dude?
Yep, that sounds like ESTP most likely.  It definitely sounds like you use a lot of Se.
Sorry dude, it's just my reaction to your sad attempt at an insult. It really seems like INFPs need to take classes on how to properly insult someone. Too much softness is a fault.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OniTIeellt0  Literally all I've been thinking about since last night.
Pizza. Except the gross school pizza you get at the cafeteria
Sweet, I'm gay too!
It's a shame ENFPs have the worst function Ne. Ne/Fi is a sad stack I feel bad for you folks
Sounds kinda similar to me dude, so maybe ESxP. Maybe ESFP? Although, I wouldn't be surprised if you were ENTP. You're definitely ExxP though, hands down.
No joke I got distracted by all the pandas in this video. I love pandas what the heck  In my case, I try to be as motivational and including as possible (which above ^ seems to be getting at). When...

Only for the perks.
I think a lot of ISFJs have been hurt so badly in the past that they've put their guards up way high. How do I show her that I'm not like one of those guys she's dated? Do I make the moves, or let...
She didn't respond to my text for 3 days :( ISFJs, do you ever give a person a second chance? what about third? and fourth? and so on?
Books that make me a better person. Cheesy, but 'tis my answer to your inquiry.

I'm borderline ISTP/ESTP.  As Sensors, we like aesthetics, so for starters you could probably start giving more care to your body and looks. Things like staying fit or clean nails would be good...

How much communication do you want/need with your date/spouse/significant other when away from each other? Every day? Every other day?   (I've just begun dating an ISFJ).

I don't know if waRM would be more accurate, WArm, or if they're both accurate (in my case, anyway). It kind of changes based on the situation and people involved. I can be the social chameleon and...'"


1281: 'Blowing up in your face seems like a bit of an overreaction, but I can definitely see where he is coming from.  I'm more introverted than most introverts I know, and it gets very irritating when...
It took me a while to figure out how to word it myself. Mostly, he was mad at me for whining at him incessantly. I was anxious, though, I could hardly control what was happening to me, and all I...
I mostly said I'll see how he reacts, because when I promised him I would step it up and do better in school, he didn't believe me, and the only way he will is if I actually do it. But doing well...
I was being extremely whiny. That's why I understand him getting upset at me.  It's just that another time we got in an argument and stopped talking (about a year ago?) he told me that his life was...
At first I felt this way, but then I made a mistake and stopped thinking rationally and could not get over how mean he was being. I think the thing that hit me the hardest was when he said he doesn't...
Spot on. He tried to tell me to get over it and step it up in school, but he was so disappointed in me which made it hard for me to feel better. So I kept being needy, and begging him to not be mad...
Wow... I didn't know this was a common thing for INTJs to do,but it makes perfect sense when I think about it. I actually started a thread about it a couple hours ago, and was too dumb to notice this...
He knows about them, its just that today it went too far- I got VERY emotional. Sobbing and all. And he can't deal with me when I'm like that, which I understand. My problem was how mean he was being...
So this was interesting. I'm an INTP with a history and depression and high anxiety, and also likely some form of ADHD. I got treatment for the depression, which worked for a while, but with school...
INTP here, but NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE.
Irrationality, stupidity. Whether it's myself or someone else. Whenever I do make a stupid mistake, or become very emotional for some reason, or make myself look bad in front of somebody who I have...
I don't think it has to do with how emotional you are. There are Thinkers who have a lot of emotions, and there are probably Feelers who are not very emotional. I always thought it just referred to...
Oh, also any sort of pseudo-activism. It started with the Facebook and the If 1000000000000 people click like, we'll cure this little girl's cancer! pages. Then there was the Kony thing. And now...

Honestly, I still don't know if I am an INTP or not. I am interested in philosophy and theories, I'm extremely lazy, I hate nature, and I always tended to relate more to the INTP threads. And every...
You know you're an introvert when you're hanging out with friends one night and they're all having fun and all you can think about is leaving to go to the gas station before it closes and getting a...
I thought that too... Brittany Matthews - ENTJ MacKenzie Zales - ESFJ Shay Van Buren - ISTP Saison Marguerite - INFP ...?
I tend to be a very stressed out person, and usually I have to eventually vent. First I'll list and try all the options I can to solve the problem in the most simple and preferable way possible....
I'm curious as to why some of you think Naota is an INFP? He seems to just be a very depressed INTP...  I would say Haruko - ENTP Mamimi - IxFP Ninamori - INTJ Kamon - ESFP
People who can't have a conversation that doesn't involve their social/love life. NO1CURR, YO. ENFJ friend who will not stop talking to me about his new girlfriend. Whoopdee-damn-doo, yes it's nice...
This. I wouldn't necessarily think that the gender difference between the T/F is really that significant. Maybe a bit of it is innate, but I think it is mostly because of social constructs- most...
Okay so Ive seen an Invader Zim thread around before, but I've never actually seen somebody type Jhonen himself, and very rarely have I seen typings of his other characters.  So personally, I think...
Aside from Bridesmaids, Mean Girls, and Easy A, I don't care for them. At all. Especially romantic comedies- ick.
INTP, atheist. Just because I see no real evidence of a God, and therefore, I don't want to spend the one life I have being afraid of a powerful divine being that probably doesn't exist anyway. Some...
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE SUPER UNDERGROUND AND ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE YOU DON'T LABEL YOURSELF WITH A TYPE? HUH?!  Haha no, but really, how come you unknowns are unknown? Do you know your type, but just...
Not sure if that's an INFP thing really, I'm an INTP and I felt like that back when I was depressed (although I guess I wasn't an INTP then, since you can't type somebody while they have a mental...
Lol. These are so conniving and brilliant. I like it. That said, I can maybe understand the INFP's motives too. I mean, it depends. If you guys aren't that close, and he's/she's just an attention...
I guess I'm kind of a people-pleaser. But only because I hate interacting with people, and I don't want to create any conflict, because then there's a chance I'd have to deal with them bitching,...
What do you guys do in a situation where you have any sort of emotional energy that NEEDS to be released? Does that even happen to other INTPs? Or do most of you just brush it off? Curious because I...
I thought it seemed like the girl is running away from something, towards something else. The storm doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. Maybe like somebody leaving a tedious life, for greater...
Yeah, I'm usually almost undoubtedly an INTP, but I became more like an extremely unstable INFP back when I had depression. Ive just concluded that you can't really type a person accurately when they...

I would agree with the people saying INFPs. Not saying that all of them are, but I just think they're the most likely to be! I was talking to my INFP friend and she was saying how she could never...

I don't quite understand, and it could be that I'm new here, and to MBTI and behavioral psychology in general, but is that to say that this is a way of somewhat determining somebody's type? According...
The INTP/Js aren't unfeeling, per se. We have emotions, some of us are even very passionate, but we just don't like to express emotions to anyone except maybe those really close. The only people who...
I agree with everyone saying that it has to do with society deeming it okay for women to show emotion, but not men. I have my emotional moments, and they can be intense, but it's very occasional,...

This is the reason why I suck at studying ffffffu
I'm a perceiver and I do this all the time. Other perceivers always bug me about it, but I only do it so I don't have to possibly deal with some sassy driver who won't let me into their lane at the...
Oh, ha, I just meant more the fact that I was purposefully trying to make my feelings seem more intense because I felt like that would be normal, which I've heard is a kind of INTP thing to do....
You would be correct with that assumption. I'm pretty new to learning about MBTI, and while I've read some into these, I'm still trying to fully understand them, which I guess just comes in time...'"

I can't help but laugh at this !!!! RIP to your dad!!!
I know an ISFJ that I dated who has a tick with his head, it's actually kinda cute. I think he does this when he gets nervous though.

Ahh, yup. Misconstrued information. I can understand why he might of thought that as its very crude and restated thing for EXFJ's Socionics which is why I sort of avoided it. Fi types may be for you...
Well what was it you didn't agree with?
Well, I'm no expert on the socionics. I understand that it works on the superego, the ego, and the ID. However, Fe and Si are both present at least... Are those functions you identify with?
Well I can agree with the stumped part, Ennegram was a life saver honestly.Finding out I was a 4w5 made alot more sense of the situation and the current mistype I have. It says more about the person...
Well I'm not exactly sure what your asking but typing in general is something that can be difficult to ascertain and I've had my own lengthy experience. Did you try by cognitive functions? Also, are...

Yup. By the way, he is also the maker of the video I described that tals about the irrational axis.

This is true. I feel like so many people need assistance with it and it is really hard to compile all that information overtime. Honestly, If I didn't have Kitty23, I'm not quite sure what I would...
I also. It seems that a miscount for ennegram and other external stimuli and test direction seem to steer us to different characters. The whole reason for functions using used is to avoid the subtle...
Huh, I guess that makes sense. I guess I really didn't understand that and have done very little ennegram work. I suppose being a rw4 (seems less extreme) would make sense as the intellectual...
Well you certainly seem to be someone attuned to their surroundings and experiences and like to be caught up so you are most likel a sensor and you definently show some preference to thinking so I'm...
Come to think of it, I guess I don't have the cleanest spot record when it comes to socialization. My relationships can be pretty half hazard and are usually the joking kind if not the intellectual...
Well maybe I have the same situation of just being another type in functions. Just to test it, I took 3 test in a row with time in between and they all came out INTP actually.  Also, I'm a true...
Ah ok. I tried familiarizing myself with it and I feel I may be either a 4w5 SP or 9 SX. There both really depressing types but I can agree to both the inner pain concept of the type 4 and then the...
Well I haven't mastered or gained any significant knowledge, especially in math. INTP's seem to have good integrity for knowledge and focusing on that knowledge. I know I have Fe in my stack...
Yea, its weird and out of my medium a bit. It appears that a 4w5 SP wouldn't be too off I guess. It's depressing really. I naturally feel different I guess but I figured everybody felt like that and...
Would you say type 9 for instinctual because it shows up on my social variant, but 4w5 for instinctual SP which I'm not sure what that means.
Well thanks, I guess I'd forgotten that I'd worked that out at some point. Sorry for the miss information as I'll have to recheck my log for when I'd discovered that enegramm type. I vaguely remember...
Well thanks, I didn't know that was a possibility. I took one along time ago and was ennegram type 7 I think but I'll have to think about it.
I actually received a neutral on mine. I guess that just means I;m somewhat doing what always makes sense and it would explain my airy moral code and sense of person so no types that have Fi or...
Well that means alot coming from an ENTP. I doubted it more or less because how awkward the descriptions were for socialization. I mean while I have a hard time reading how I come off and...
Interesting post, I suppose I could try again as I haven't taken more than two really.
While I will say that these qualities are pretty left field from what I would expect of an ENFP, I suppose you have a reason to believe your not an ENFP. ENFP's can be worried, but you do have a sort...
I did cognitive function order to find my type but never actually tried a questionnaire and was recommended to see some other peoples opinions through this. Will take follow up questions also. ...

I understand this totally. This is in essence the make up of an INFJ.  It is also exactly why a relationship with an ESTP will not work. There is no end to the analysis and eventually this drives...

Hello fellow Set. That's my term for an ESTP. It is so much more efficient and explanatory. 1 syllable instead of 4, 3 letters instead of 4, and you can tell the cognitive functions right away...

INTJs, ESTJs, ESFJS, ENFJS and people of my own type in my experience.  I rarely get offended, though, especially since I'm so blunt with other people.

You must not be one or you would understand.  Nothing wrong with someone that licks and spits on food for others to eat?!?!?!?!  You must have bypassed the article.

You don't know many estps huh? Lol. I think that because words equate to action for me.
Have fun going off and fucking yourself. Kind of defeats the purpose of finding someone to share the intimate experience of orgasaming, no?
I take it you've never had the displeasure of bad sex. :X  Connection and trust is important for me as well. Sex can just as easily, and quicker in ways, bridge the gap with some one you're...
Is waiting something people do? Wasting my time to get to know you, only to find out you're terrible at the sex is a huge turn off. Schedules or distances aside, if you ain't keeping up with my...

Haircuts.  I'm sorry but when I am getting my haircut, I don't want to talk to you. I don't know you, I can't hear you well, and I won't be seeing you again until 30-45 days from now. So shut up,...

Every estp shows enough traits to probably be diagnosed NPD and ADHD and ASD. Doesn't mean shit.
As a start, give me a specific example of what leads you to believe he isn't estp or is has NPD.

You won't guilt him into taking you back. It wasn't meant to be. Focus your energy into finding a guy that's right for you and let this one go.
It wasn't really my thing. I got bored after a page or 2 of it.  I could find him pretty quickly but it was boring.

That sounds exactly like infatuation. :)  By the way, I know fluent Greek. Hahah. While they might have different words, agape and phile are pretty much the same thing and storge doesn't even...
Getting married, having kids or even conventional work should not be considered the default or something you have to do. Doing things just because others choose to do said things would be stupid...
While the thread seems answered, I want to add that once you realise what 'love' actually is, the basic chemical reactions and realise that people can be manipulated into feeling that in many ways,...
Honesty is key in friendships and especially relationships, so clearly she doesn't belong. Your friend is probably attached to what she provides (not actually her as a person) and doesn't realise it,...
You should never have been chasing others in the first place. Take a relaxed approach and if somebody is genuinely interested in you, something will probably happen. No effort or desperation...
Regarding her child, I'd say in this situation that's a part of her life that you should not get involved in.  Also, 'rude' is somewhat subjective so perhaps she doesn't think she's being rude.
I do not doubt that you may be highly intelligent, but clearly you have some issues with staying motivated on one thing long term. I assume this is because they actually bore you and then you...
Don't take the advice of the person above me, that's nonsense. You get nowhere playing petty games like a kid. You don't need to ask to follow him, just go ahead and do it. Keep a casual mentality,...
I think the most important traits in people as a whole are honesty, intelligence and a little bit of comedic worth. Obviously it helps if they have good eyebrows too.

It makes sense not to just pursue, often it's better to let things happen if they do occur naturally.
Have you tried enjoying nature or something? Soothing self reflection?
That's hard to say, so many names. It's nice being in London though cause you always see the artists around casually and they're a laugh. Anyway, if you want to link up some time, drop me a PM and we...
Just an afterthought, do you live in or near London? You could come to a grime rave with me some time if you like.
Are you here to demonstrate what a better video would look like?  You have no duty to tell her though, just let it sit there. If she ever gets into a mess for it, it's her own fault.
I have a few little points to make here. Firstly, some of your friends by your description seem like they might actually be ill themselves. Disregarding that, I concur that the only people worth...
Getting rid of those feelings is a matter of replacing them with better things. Keep busy and let the time pass. Perhaps study how human thought processes work a bit more so you have more of an...
Of course not. Different topics, a fresh start, no grudges. By the way, are you doing better?

I think it would help if you didn't put the power in everybody else's hands instead of your own. You don't have to live on the validation of others.

Maybe you're witnessing some sort of social media effect, where people tend to only post pics and stuff of them having fun or doing 'good' things, so viewing all of that tricks people into thinking...
I help others a lot and never ask for or require help.

I know what those MBTI terms mean but why a difference in the preferences must be a problem for you is not quite clear to me
Nevermind if you're not able to put it into more words
Because it was my own guesses not what you said actually.  I repeat my question: are ESTP's not  imaginative, speculative or spiritual enough or what else are you missing about ESTP's?
I see these replies only now. Still, this about not introverted, intuitive, feeling, or judging... was not saying anything. Not imaginative, speculative or spiritual enough or what?
Again... why? I'd like to hear more about this. Are we just too different or seem to be too different?     Yeah uh again why don't you think it would?
why?
I'm also curious what sounds INTP-ish about OP :)
Well it can be applied too but you got it I think. :)  As for the logical paradoxes: those are not necessarily a problem. But tell me which paradoxes you thought of in terms of reality containing...
well I still think maybe xxTP. :) (N probably yeah)  but I hope someone else will chime in with more expertise!

True, that. I just wouldn't know when a function qualifies to be dominant. I don't have any function that's truly always on. Unless you can count the fact that even when I'm thinking about...
Interesting... are those symbols supposed to be arbitrary, that is, nothing to do with generic well known symbols?  I dislike certain symbols, usually those well known ones or mystical/esoteric...
Lol. What's the link to it?  So/sx or so/sp does make sense for you I think. :)
well if you want :) it's interesting stuff. but I was thinking maybe you have social instinct. social 7, could totally work for you..
Yeah, I see, I guess we work differently there. Probably not MBTI related then.  What is your dominant instinct in enneagram? So, Sx, Sp?
Lol, which parts felt insulting?
Why would you want to force yourself to be interested in whatever you are not currently interested in? Who the fuck cares about expectations related to your age? There's many ways to enjoy living....
Heh okay I see. I get your analogy though I don't agree. ESFP's could still have good skills in logic, just not using it as a preference in their lives.     Okay.
Ah I see :) So when did you feel trapped then?  Btw it was so very enneagram 7-ish. That description about being trapped.
in other words, stay at home mom?  (I'm just trying to relate this to whatever else you said in another thread :) )
sorry I don't know martial arts that well so I don't know what kind of analogy you meant here ?? :) (ESFP, IQ, tai chi)
exactly. ESFP can have really high IQ too. :)
Ah hmm one more thing I thought of, with regard to focus on sensations. I think I can sum this up best in this way, I don't focus on the sensory data in the way descriptions seem to suggest it should...
Philosophical in what way? You mean it's just a theoretical idea?  I dunno if I have extra-groundedness. Some people do say I am materialistic and grounded sure... but more than the average person?...

it's hard to see it, it's unconcious usually  what is that bashing like? example?

Se = doesn't think of future, just act Ni = helps Se types slow down by helping with timing of action
Yes but the theory could incorporate that.     Sure but why give the same name to all these different definitions.
They are not definitions, they are traits correlating *best* with the type.  The same goes for the listed jobs. Just correlations.     Simple but how do we define introversion/extraversion? No...

I wonder why Why we like ESFJs is only 7 pages long, and this dislike thread is 107 pages long, even though they both came out in 2011.
No problem, friend!
Ask away!
Tell me what you think!  Just knocked this one off this afternoon.  Moon River - Clyp
Well, that was a very heartfelt post!  I'm sure if my mother could read it (an ISFJ) she would be quite flattered.
Of course!  I dream all the time.  Common misconception.
My father is an ISTJ.  He has good qualities, but cannot stand his apparent self-centeredness when it comes to disturbing other people's privacy and etc.
Newt Gingrich was an obvious ENTP and he absolutely loved to debate.  That was his big strong suit in the 2012 campaign.
I would think ENTJ fiction would be very long and winding, with many metaphors and complicated prose.
I have no idea why.  My uncle is an INTP and he is a memorizing genius, as well as very warm in his own quirky way.  If people don't like him, that's their problem, not his.
I don't think ESTP's get hated on most..I think that honor goes to my personality type!
My brother is a true ESTP, and we get along great.  He is good-natured, and so am I.  We're both people people.
Not at all.  One of my best friends is an ISTP and he is wonderful.  A real person, if that makes any sense.
I have no idea why others dislike us!  In real life, plenty of people seem to like me, so I think it's the internet that's off and not me.
When I'm really upset, having other people around sort of shocks me out of it and forces normalcy.    Being alone too long isn't good for anyone, in my opinion.  It feels unhealthy and depressing.
The fact that you are introspecting on this topic leads one to believe that you type as ISFJ.  An ESFJ would not really care about this.
I type as ESFJ and enjoy many different styles, such as: Classical, ragtime, jazz, easy listening (Dean Martin, Bing Crosby, etc.), 50s-70s pop, 70s soul, and retro country.
Sounds like he is acting like the bigger person here.  I'm sure you realize you screwed up and your behavior as described is never the right way to respond to unwanted affection b/c it shows lack of...'"

I agree with you all the way.  Go out with him find whats relevant to him and he will not shut up.

So pretty much there are never any new ESTPs?
it's fine swish. You have been on here longer than me. Do ESTPs come and go as often as people say on here?
I can't remember where but I remember reading the actual number based on people who have had there MBTI tested was 2.8% putting us at the 3rd rarest type spot
That explains why I never see any ESTPs in the ESTP forum :shocked:
That is true but this is fun too. :tongue:
HELLO AND WELCOME :happy:
Billy Mays died today. Makes me feel kinda sad. Although that means today is..... ALL CAPS DAY. PEOPLE SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR THIS. :crazy:

You don't need a boyfriend to get cute pictures from a guy silly.
Well hello there and welcome.
as an ESTP myself I can tell you I am usually very protective over all my friends and ex's when it comes to their safety and well being.
I agree with infpnerdgirl you need to stand up for your self. I can see you don't want to hurt him seeing as you are his only friend, but what you should do is confront him and tell him exactly...
Ive gone through this entire thread in search of ESTP posters and only found a small small number compared to almost every other type can some one please give me a influx of ESTP posters?
I am googling if spiders sleep or not as i just walked through a large spider web in my kitchen.
you know your a ESTP when you are talking to someone and see something interesting but continue talking and forget you were, leading the other person to utter confusion.
My best friend is a INTJ and we get along very well. We may not see eye to eye on alot of issues but we keep each other going. He keeps me on task and i get him to try new experiences and meet new...
I agree with this fully and also add that not being able to fix a problem i need to for lack of proper skills drives me crazy. And also a good work out is great to relieve stress.
Personally i have never cheated but with every serious relationship i have been in ive been fooled or cheated on and my trust in relationships longevity is very corrupted because of this.
i find myself relatively always busy if not with friends or doing some random thing im running 'What if?' Scenarios in my mind but i need my cave time usually half a day or a full day completely off...
oh you XD im glad i listened to you and joined this site its fun
I tend to read peoples body language without realizing it but I do watch their eyes because they always seem to give away what they are thinking or what their next move will be
I have rebellious tendencies that seem to come out strongly when someone tries to get me to do something I dont want to or dont see logical
How do you view and handle theory? theories are usually a jumble of assumptions so i like to play devils advocate and poke holes on its logic with facts How does your Ti work in contrast to ENTPs?...
If you give an ESTP a hug...It will be the best hug of your life! =]:tongue:
im swinging on saying ESTP but also ENTP sounds very good as well to fit the bill
That does seem like a possibility he could want emotional input from you or his mind is made and he is asking for your opinion to weigh it against his
I have realized there is no thread for this on the ESTP forum and am curious to see what everybody says
i would be very distraught not only for lack of contact with friends but because i manage all my email acounts and various internet business accounts from it and i would be very out of my groove but...
Not all but a good majority. I fail to see the logic behind their actions and choices.

Sandpit confirmed one was 7w8 and the other was 6w7 meaning ESFP and ESTP. If that's the case, it surely won't work. Personally I find some female ENTJs to majestic in their dispositions.

Thought female ENTJs were prone to liking the more chiseled masculine face to be enchanting?
For some odd reason I find black hair, with blue or green eyes delictable. I'm super trait specific.

I watched it again. I still think ENTJ, possibly INTJ. And since when does an ISTP speak in the way that Bane does. According to mbti databank the most votes are 8 for ISTP and 10 for xNTJ.

Time to lay down the law:  Dennis: ENTJ (He's just like eric cartman.)  MAC: ESTP (he uses Fe, look closer)  Dee: ENTP (like Bulma from dragonball z)  Charlie: ENFP (most obvious one to me)

Well, that settles it then!    Given your profile pic I don't think I want to see any more pictures from you.
Now here's something you may NOT agree with but I;m going to say it anyway because it seems the majority will disagree with me once again. I think Tywin could be an Si user. I just watched season 2...
yeah I worded that poorly. I think Jamie is ESTP and I think his lack of Te is apparent.
I was going to suggest the same thing considering the Fi is so apparent. Tertiary Te? Maybe. Ok maybe I have the Fi and Te out of order. Ne dom followed by Fi then Te actually makes sense. Ne Ti Fe?...
Haha okay buddy and you should feel free to read up on common English idioms like I rest my case.
I rest my case.
I mean, Te is all about controlling the external environment. Jamie doesn't try to control, he just adapts to the situation.    Tywin is really calm at all times but I think he's a psychopath....
Which is a perfect example of Te. I bet you could even picture Tywin saying the SAME THING. The whole concept of imposing your will onto other people is Te. Quick, unstoppable rage with the sole...

I thought that he was an INTJ but lately I've sort of changed my mind thinking he's an ENTP. He seems really non-diplomatic.

Finally somebody gets it.
The answer to any Who is the best ______? is always INTJ, don't you know this by now?

Remember, I still don't think Cobb is an ISTP so you might want to explain that first if you're going to use him as a comparator.
Ok so the Ni-Ti loop is what I was looking for. So then she's either ISTP or xNFJ
My first instinct is to say she has a tert or inferior Ni casuing her to believe in some crazy conspiracy theory. Maybe ISFP?
You're probably right about Ariadne.
True, but he seems to be a 5w4, 1w9, 8w9. sp/??. I guess through enneagram he does seem to be more INTJ-like but probably due to social introversion. Still it seems that Te is stronger than Ni but I...
I see his extroversion in his noticeable Se as well as his constant driving-forward method of thinking. Controlling the external world or trying to achieve some kind of result is what he is about....
Cobb - ENTJ. Certainly not an ISTP. I will debate this with anyone who thinks otherwise. ISTP and INTJ are easily confused. Very weak extroversion, does not posses the typical ENTJ cool head. With...
You do. Since your type is unknown you don't have to fight.
