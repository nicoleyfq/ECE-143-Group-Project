I took the last coment a little strongly , and I apologize for the level of my response.
Since I am not 13 I find your retort, well childish.  Also since I am married to a ENFP I do not flake on them. Duty means always fulfilling;

How could she thank you when ISTJ's will clearly be the winner. I will fullfill my duty in this battle for ENFP's
I work with somone who is incompetant( slow, lazy, and  lacking in brain power). I find myself doing most of his work as well as mine. I am blessed however to get the respect from my bosses I deserve...

Well since my enneagram is The Loyal Friend I would say that I am that kind of friend.

I would have to say ENFP, because I am married to one who makes my life great!:proud:
I also go to music as a relief from trouble, but it always helps me. I especially like to listen to K-LOVE in these times.

I would have to say music is and will be a big part of my life. I like most all kinds classical, rock, alternative, reggae, pop, jazz, blues. I have been to many concerts and enjoyed them all. I have...'"

It really makes me sad when breakups happen. All those times where you actually thought that the two of you would have a future together is all gone. And it also sucks how it's as if it never...
Sigh. It’s a sad thing to say but I guess you’re right. Nothing I can do anymore if his friends have a stronger influence on him than I have. It’s just pretty sad how it was like it never existed in...
Well.. because thinking of the good times will lead to me missing the person that he once was. Good times are nice to think of but really, sometimes they bring back so much pain for me.  Haha, no,...

It's worth learning, especially the intertype relations. The basic idea is that all the types have access to all eight functions, but they only really want to use four of them.
I love interacting with Ne types, especially _NFPs. Two of my best friends in high school were ENFPs. My INFP sister and I used to fight terribly, but around the time she turned 13, we suddenly...

As an ISTJ, I sometimes have difficulty understanding how ENTPs think. I'm particularly interested in how they handle moral decisions.  If you don't put stock in Socionics or functions, you can...

Judging by your avatar, perhaps ISTP. By your posting history, perhaps INTP.

ISTJ here. NB: I rely pretty heavily on function theory here.  I absolutely disagree. Sensing is a pretty unfortunate misnomer, because it makes one think of the five senses and a focus on the...
The whole focus on tradition and rules with Si-doms is somewhat misplaced. When it comes to rules and traditions, i.e. existing systems, the reasoning is, This system isn't here for no reason....

The best thing you can do is be yourself. We are extremely good at telling when somebody is being fake, and we hate it. Just be yourself. If he's not interested in you then, you're wasting your time.
If he's sending mixed signals, it's because he's trying to work up the courage to do something about how he feels. Ask him about his feelings for you, but do not be confrontational about it. For...
I like how you excluded ISFJs.  Introverted Sensing is just so... boring, isn't it?  /sarcasm  Actually, though, I think that INF_s are no more capable (ability is independent of type); they're...

I very strongly disagree. That portrait captures only surface behaviour and not the underlying thought processes behind it, and it also contains a good deal of incorrect information.
For this post I'm going to assume you know about functions. If you don't, read this.  This is the Socionics description of the SLI/ISTp (Socionics SLI/ISTp = MBTI ISTJ). Importantly, it includes...

ENFP. Same functions, reversed order, meaning that we share the same values, and that they are strong where we are weak and weak where we are strong, so we can reinforce each other. I'm a teacher...
I find passive aggressive behaviour difficult to sustain. I dislike it when others use it to try to send a message; I'd rather have them tell me what's wrong straight to my face, so I can fix it....
My mother is an ISTJ. We think exactly alike, and disagreements stem mainly from differences in opinion or experience and not from personality.
The thing about ISTJs is that we are absolutely terrible at gauging how other people feel, so even if we think somebody likes us, we do nothing, because that's the safest course of action, and we're...
Those descriptions are not that detailed. This description of the ISTJ/SLI/ISTp and this description of the ISTP/LSI/ISTj are longer, meatier, and more detailed.  It's easy to mistake a type for...
Where did you get the function stack Si-Te-Ni-Se? That's not possible in MBTI or Socionics. Socionics functions 1, 2, 6, and 5 = MBTI dominant, auxiliary, tertiary, and inferior, respectively. This...

It does, to an extent. It's not perfect, but it's far better than anything else I've read. I'd suggest reading through all of the different type pages, if only because it's interesting and the...
I think the descriptions are short-sighted. For me, Si demands a constant input of information. I often find myself staying up past midnight reading or working because I can't bear shutting down...
I like it. It seems very honest, like you're doing your best to reveal to others your own way of seeing the world, without pretension.
Those descriptions were not very accurate at all, because they look at surface behaviours and not their underlying causes. Loyalty and reliance on tradition are just a couple of possible...
...This is entirely accurate.
ISTJ. Atheist.  I was raised an atheist. Having examined the facts, I see no reason to become religious. I find the concept of accepting an idea or ideology purely on faith, without logical or...
My ESTP dad taught me how to avoid taking things at face value, and to really think about things before accepting them as true (Se-Ti), which I've found to be an invaluable skill. He also taught me...

I am not sure I understand. Are you asking if we would see that we are being used? If that is the question, speaking just for myself... yes. I recently ended a relationship for that very reason.
You are who you are. She is what she is. The way you show love was not what she perceives as being love. Some people have needs that many ISTJs cannot give.   Look at it this way- if you are a...
We ISTJs do better in stressful situations when we know what is happening. You should have told him about the issues from your life changing situation so he understood why you got upset so easily. ...
I am not sure what you mean by drama, but if an ISTJ sees you as an impediment to getting their work done properly, they will not just let things go.
The key to understanding ISTJs- ask us.... really.    Go to her and ask for 5 minutes to talk. When you get the time to talk, tell her you think there is friction between you two and ask what you...
Same here. Communication was difficult, at best.
Two things-  1) You may want to try meetup.com, and attend activities that interest you. Build relationships based on mutual interest. 2) If you do online dating again, mention your type in your...

She is controlling you through negative behavior.  She is rude and you give her what she wants. Generally speaking, you get more or what you encourage and you get less of what you discourage. Stop...
First- don't assume. Ask him to take an MBTI test to KNOW if he is ISTJ or not.  Second- make your intentions clear. We tend to respect and respond to directness and clarity.
It's not that an ISTJ will hold back for the purpose of depriving an ENFP. It's that the ENFP needs more communication and on a different level than the ISTJ has to give.  Look at it this way- a...
Communicating with an ENFP can be draining for an ISTJ... even with loved ones.  For the ISTJ, it seems like the ENFP is trying to pull info and emotion out of us. Sometimes the ISTJ will resist,...

In your OP you spoke of reactions and clues. Additionally, I note you are ENFP.   ISTJs and ENFPs often have a difficult time communicating.  It has been my experience that ENFPs can miss what an..."

People who take my feelings for them as granted.
I just hate it when someone, say the girl you like, decides that you aren't worth her time to respond. :unsure:
I know the feeling.. The little things matter to me, like saying hi in the hallways at school, or responding to my texts. Sometimes when people don't do the little things I like I tend to loose...
I hate it when people try and make me dance:angry: I just stand there awkwardly. :crazy:
Story of my life? I hate to say it, but I've lost so many close friends because of my lack of effort into it. The way I look at it is, if they don't spend the time to talk to me, why should I talk...
I never really thought about it that way, but now that I look on the past girls I've liked, they've been pretty hidden and modest..
That sounds slightly similar to my actions when I'm interested in a girl. I never make the first move, and you'd expect that I'd only like girls who try to make an effort to get closer to me but I...
I know, I've never really written anything thats really outrageous. And most of it is anonymous anyway.

One of the things I've noticed about what I've been feeling is that if I say it I would might offend someone, I don't like to do that. I also hate talking about myself..
Thats a great explanation of the feeling. Writing seems to be my best release of feelings and such.
Thats similar to how I am. Unless I'm with someone who makes me genuinely happy I just look  like I'm sad.   This is one of the few ways I can, but most times the person just feels like responding...

His description sounds like me or the most part and I'm a ISTJ. The only thing that seems radically different is the fact that I have no self-confidence.

Uhmmm, lets see. The house key, the first 3 ridges are medium sized with a 20* slope. lolwut? Thanks :crazy:
Honestly, I can't put my finger on it. It could be people who don't think logically. Just certain traits just really bother me.. I'm really unsure, I'm still trying to figure myself out.
Hmm, I never really thought of western culture defining someones personality so much. Its just that people who don't think like me get on my nerves, and if someone gets on my nerves or bothers me I...
I could see how that works, Thanks!
Hm, maybe there are more people around me that are similar then I know of.. So chances are if I meet another ISTJ they are a male? Why is that?
I'm sorry if this question has been asked and answered before, :blushed: But I'm not really looking for a statistic, I just want to know many of us are out there. I know some personality types are...
Honestly I've never been a fan of the RX-8, I've heard the new rotaries aren't as reliable as the old ones, but I still love them :P. I wouldn't mind a Supra myself.'"


1501: No, no I haven't. I don't know that I can objectively, I've read too much. I think I need someone to assess me.
I agree with your point about Te, just based on statistics alone it is much more likely that I am istj. But I would still like to explore Si and Ni further.
Thanks for the response, I think your right I will have to have someone help me to type myself as opposed to trying to type myself. I will look on the sub forums as you suggested though.
I don't know how to determine which is my dominant function. Everyone dose both to some extent, but I'm just not sure which is my dominant function. The reason I've started to question this is...
lol, thanks I think I sorted out the female part but I'm still not sure about the S or N part.

I know exactly what your talking about, not an intj but what you described is what happens with me.

I don't know that I have met one, would like to get to know a infj.
I feel he doesn't like SJ types and that maybe it can't work based on that. His perfectionism is directed outward on to me and he is very critical. Its been 7 years on and off near the end.
Thats exactly it he says he doesn't want to keep hurting me. He says he dosent see a future. I feel like I ve lost him. He says he isn't able to reciprocate in the relationship. I don't know if this...

I am an istj but I feel the same about my type, glad to know I'm not only one. I am very frustrated by unhealthy or underdeveloped istjs.
I feel like I get punished for this all the time : (
No I don't understand how an intp or intj can be religious.It would be very interesting to talk to a religious intp or intj. It seems counterintuitive to me would like to understand it.
Curious, I don't understand how this is possible please explain.
Excited about this tread, I have not seen a lot of posts on intp and istj relationships. I have been with an intp for 7 years on and off in the past few. I could write you a book on Intps. I actually...
Theroretical question what would a relationship bw  an infj and an istj look like is it even possible?
Many people hate being told they are wrong, and bluntness and direct communication is something they see as aggressive. Do you care about what they think when you are direct?

Lol good point
That's fair
Sounds pretty judgmental, I've had a pretty bad experience with an intp type proff so did an intp in the class.

Its the difference bw intps and intj, intjs want you to understand if its important to them. Intps gave up 5 mins ago and mentally/physically walked away.
Those the nosie that comes with parades bother intjs as well? I don't like nosie distracts me from my thoughts, but maybe that's an S thing and N types can tune it out.
Lol, I enjoy being physically close to my intp but in slience so we can both be with our thoughts or sometimes listening to music in the car. But mostly the silence.
It sounds harsh it is but his intention wasn't to hurt me. He didn't really think that one through. Blunt honsesty is part of the istj/intp package, I just wish he didn't feel that way.
Thanks will respond with a private message when I have chace
I feel that your description is very accurate, I know how hard it is for them but I guess the it not being natural didn't matter because I see the effort involved and means a lot to me.

Distinction for what? If it's only bad to discriminate when it has to do with factors that a person is born into then by definition that would exclude religious converts.
Great. So according to this it would be okay to discriminate against religious converts... after all it was their choice to convert and their choice to accept those beliefs.
True, but surely this alone wouldn't be a good enough reason to get rid of political parties altogether, especially when they exist in virtually every country where citizens can vote.    If the...

It's that obvious, eh?
If I travel somewhere/stay at somebody's house, I bring everything plus an itemized list so I don't forget anything.
I'm always late.
We don't need any damn rules.
1. ISTJ  2. Atheist  3. My parents aren't religious and they never brought up religion when I was growing up.
I think we should host the party at my place.
Are you telling me that INFJs are trained assassins? :ninja:
I'm not sure if I've ever had anybody say I'm boring to my face, but I'm sure people have had that thought about me. I know I am boring, but I don't need somebody telling me that to my face. I don't...
Do I just name the last movie I watched? I watched High Plains Drifter last night.
Well, that may be true, but I like my chances of staying unmarried.
I don't see myself ever getting married.
I'm an ISTJ. I don't have an interest in smoking weed, but I don't mind if other people want to legalize it.

It's time for a dance contest.
I don't care if we're late.
ISTJ. I don't have a religion and I wasn't brought up in any kind of religion.
I've never taken a legitimate IQ test, but I do have a mild interest in take one someday.
Hugs for everybody!
I scored a 33.
I bleached my hair blonde when I was 14. That was 12 years ago and I still regret it, hah."

Red Orchestra and I played Rising Storm 2 Vietnam last week.
We get things done this way. Fun comes after and you get to have your fun too. And Happy29 will provide us with some good food. :proud:
Always need some good food. Besides it's a meeting with a party after it.
Seems like we will have a great party then thanks to the both of you. :wink:
Maybe that is the way it goes with ESFPs, but not here. The pack will have to discuss on a good leader and then we can have fun. Since fun is your weakness (and perhaps that of other ESFPs too),...
You know, it's important. Business first, then there is time for fun like a rap battle (But I'm not a rapper).
If others want one, then we go for one. But since we are talking about our subforum with black as it's colour, it could also just be a relaxed, casual meeting where we just go over pros and cons of...
Exactly, that is why we need to talk about it instead of having a big war game. One strategy could lead to a big waste of resources and then we are further away from our initial goal.
There isn't.
In the style of, not a game mode. xD    It is just all out warfare, all the time.
That's cute, but I meant it more in the style of Warhammer 40k instead of team deathmatches and FFAs. xD
I like ESTJs. I do not see them as a loud version of myself, although goals could overlap.   Hehe, nothing wrong with being serious. Jokes have a time and a place.    A pack leader, so is this...
You could lose some resources in the meanwhile that you may need later on and that would not be a great idea.
You know, the leader should be the one who is most capable, not one who wins some contest/battle.
You know how I imagine that?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1dAs0aWas8  In all seriousness, if we ever need a leader, I think we would all sit around a table and actually discuss it. xD
I think packs would fit. The ones who we do trust will get our full trust. It is just the issue of who we let in the pack. :P
I don't know. I assume modern times since you brought it up while I suggested you stay here to admire the subforum colour. xD
It makes sense, but now it raises another question. Just like with our colour black, are we the wolves or men in that question? :P
https://m.popkey.co/acc842/XRvMx.gif  Or you could just stay with here with us and enjoy the subforum colour with us.
No, no it's not. We just keep black as our color. After all, money is money regardless of it's colour.

Depends on who it is.
Now I wonder if I should tell things about my infp girlfriend and me [emoji13]   Verstuurd vanaf mijn Nexus 5 met Tapatalk
Sleep through it (although for 14 hours...) or talk with INTP about games or something. Answering the what if questions from the others wouldn't be that bad unless it goes on for 3 hours. :crazy:...
You know, that would save people some time if they did that. It will make it easier for some, but people do not like being blunt or confess something (like feelings for someone).

2083: Thanks for assuaging my fears!   Guess ive seen my ISTJ dad chase away enough friends to think it might happen to me too.    Curious, any of you guys feel this way?
Good idea. The good news is that they do know i like my space. But i'm just worried because, being my first experience, i wouldn't know when i need to recharge. I tend to get grumpy, i've noticed.
Fellow ISTJ's, i have an odd question.   In dec, i'll be traveling with 2 friends of mine (they're a couple) for a total of 16 days. During which, our accommodations will be apartments so there's...
A little late to the party. But here's mine. We dated for a while.   Dislikes:   Stubbornness, is a completely opposite way we are. We are stubborn about how there's usually a 'best way' to do...
Yes, i'm going to have to agree with you on this, having been on the receiving end before.  Though, if they're talking to you, it's always a good sign.
Workplace.   The first one had numerous (if not all) characteristics of INTPs, and members' analysis of her behavior confirmed my assessment. The second one was pretty similar to the first.
Unwittingly.
Don't worry, i'm not condemning all INTPs, or even any INTPs.   I'm just feeling a little ranty. And sad, about getting rejected again.
One year after getting my heart broken by an INTP, and i find myself dating another INTP.   I wish this one had a happier ending, but i just got the 'i don't think things will work out in the long...
So, do INFJs jump straight into dating?   Or do they prefer the whole 'let's be friends first' song and dance?   Though i can't say for sure if attraction is there at this point.
I know it will help when talking to try to get straight to the point.   And personally, if i found someone annoying, i'll avoid them. I won't tell them they were annoying.   Source: Dated an ENFP.
Heh, you really do know how to talk to ISTJ's. This is exactly what i'm looking for. Thanks a million! And good luck with your istj.
Yes, silly me. That would've been an important detail to include.   No, i don't work with her. We met at a casual social event via a mutual friends, and they thought we might be compatible with...

Thanks for the replies.   I just can't seem to find a way to have a second chance, without outright telling her but doing that would just put more pressure on her and defeat the whole purpose.  ...

It matters to me, because that lady broke my heart once when she ended things, then once again when i saw how quickly she'd moved on. Guess i just hate being insignificant.      angelcat thanks...
I'm pretty sure that's the case here too.   But doesn't mean it can't piss me off. ;)   Hence the decision to post in this thread.

Well, in this case she hasn't mentioned wanting to end things so far. And we've been seeing each other since then. So i'm really hoping it's just that she needs space.   And you're asking an ISTJ...

I'm not very good at art. If you follow stereotypes, the ISTJ would be horrible at art. But I think you are right when you say any type can be an artist. Most people don't fit the 16 molds exactly.
I have two friends. One is an INTJ, and one is an ESFP. Ever since I was younger, I hadn't liked making friends. The last time I made one was in 4th grade. Since then, I've been to introverted to try.

You must be mixing me up with someone else. I never typed as ISTP. I do have a typing thread but ISTP was not specifically discussed as an option.  Now, to be quite honest, I don't like how you...
I don't see those as specific enough to functions. Any individual may care about these things.
Np :)     Do you relate specifically to Fi and Ne?  I'm pretty sure you are sx-first though.
You mean in a test or you mean this is the type you picked in Socionics?
I myself do have a problem with the idea of marriage as a forced symbol of things. I don't at all have a problem with the practical side of it or with the commitment.     Cool :)
Ah, so they type themselves ISTJ in MBTI and ISTj in Socionics?
OK so if this helps you somehow.. I don't mind. I've been typed ISTJ and I find it working.  I find the following questions too speculative or just plain random or pointless because nothing will be...
ENFP?  You seem real random and that is before I even read your answers. And a lot of Feeling values.  Sx-dom for your instinct, no question.
Oh heh :)  I'm not too used to seeing or hearing about people similar to me, this forum is cool.     That sounds good too.
You sound S to me from this. Strong Ni would be not this poor at connecting similar ideas, let alone strong Ne. Fi vaguely makes sense too. I'll stick to the ISFP typing.
Hm, what I see is, I observe the whole scene in one, with a sort of structure imposed over, then after orienting myself via that (very very quickly), I look at the objects inside it, a cursory glance...

Got myself a bit of a strange situation. There's an ENTJ guy I've know for about 6 years, who recently has become single, and I have never really been romantically interested in him, but I was...
Hi ENTJs. Any of you males in a relationship with an ISTJ female? Positives/challenges? I asked in the ISTJ forum but no one had any experience. I did some past searching of threads but thought it...
Any ISTJ females in a relationship with an ENTJ male? Positives and negatives? I hear it can be a good match if values and interests are similar!

What if you expose him, tell him you know he's been lying..then you have to work out what he has to do to regain your trust..and then state your terms.  For example he allows you full access to his...
Hmm..it sounds he is serious about you if you're getting married. My question to you is, how are you going to be able to trust him if he's lied to you about this relationship?
Firstly, when you said you'd 'worked really hard to get him back' BIG RED FLAG..men will do as little as possible to get as much as possible. If he's in a relationship with you then maybe he's just...
Sorry to hear it didn't work out. I don't see insecurity as being a classic ISTJ trait. Anyone can be hypersensitive to criticism...it depends on how emotionally healthy you are. I've recently just...
Haha. Thanks. In that case I will just be myself (I am very blunt)! Will stick to the non threatening factual stuff (which is my specialty anyway).
How do I attract an ESTP. There is a guy who I would describe as a 'familiar face', we have some mutual friends. I've observed him and I'm pretty sure he's an ESTP (don't ask me how I know this!!). I...

By definition, you actually have what's called a 'relations of understanding' relationship. If you are an ISTJ you can only have a semi-dual relationship with an ENTP.  ISTJ + ISTJ = relations of...

I'm not sure if I'm the exception to the rule, but I dislike tradition, and have a strong propensity to be unique..maybe it's because I'm an HSP (highly sensitive person) though.
Practically, if you're trying to spot them in the wild, I've noticed from the video threads that INTJs tend to be able to talk for long periods of time. Whereas ISTJs say a little, and then have to...

Just ran across this post when I did a google search on IxTJ.  Glad to see there's a couple others out there.  I just watched today's BBT and I might have to agree with the Sheldon example. ...
Amen to all of that.  It's so hard to be out in the public and having to fake giving an f*** about that crap.  I used to be a customer service lead and had to listen to people whine for 8 hours a...

I don't really like gifts in general but I hate the idea of a gift card or money. I don't like the societal norm that gifts need to be given by these people to those people at this time because we...
Thanks guys.  I'm enjoying this site.  It appears much more active than the previous site I was perusing.
Maybe it's more of being a male IxTJ that has little interest in updating Facebook statuses.  My thought process is if it's not life altering (new job, GF, grades, etc.) then why would someone want...

Hi there, kind and generous INFJs!  I'm in search of some tips and advice - I'm a young ISTJ guy currently pursuing a young woman who's confided in me that she is, in fact, an INFJ.   Some...
3. I tend to get focused on one specific train of thought and follow it at the expense of everything else.     Yes. I regularly forget where I put things simply because I don't pay attention when...
Nah. As a 21 year old male who just finished college, pop culture moves too fast for anyone to really understand. The people who seem like they understand are just better at pretending than everyone...
As an ISTJ, I'll be the first to admit I do this sometimes. I can definitely see one (or myself) acting something like this on camera.  Edit: ...Well, not to that degree. Man, she's kinda nuts. Haha
Being an interesting person is about 99% the way you go about life and 1% type. I know quite a few ISTJs in real life and some of them are hilarious people who are fun to be around, while others are...
I agree with this. I'd say my INTJ dad thinks like A+B...(yadda yadda yadda)...+F=G while I'm more prone to go through all of the steps (A+B+C+D+E+F=G). INTJs like to extrapolate on limited data...

Given that you don't mention getting the feeling that he's giving you trouble in sort of teasing way, I'm not sure what to think. The IM consistency is especially strange - I don't really see an ISTJ...
I just wanted to stop in because... *feeling famous* :ninja: :laughing:  Haha, but in all seriousness...If there's any way I can help, let me know. It seems like there's a lot of very good advice...
That's me around attractive girls. But it works out alright because I get the you're adorable feedback. Devious, you say?   :ninja:
Gentleman's right. He could be assuming you're just a really nice person who does that sort of thing for everyone. That wouldn't be my own conclusion, probably...but guys can be pretty oblivious. I...
Haha, most of this was a brain dump from about a year ago, but I'm glad it's been helpful to so many people.  Sure...ask away - I'll answer as time allows. :happy:
So we like to make plans while thinking only about the present? :wink:  It's worded fine. You could leave him to plan the outing; if he's really busy however, he may push it to the side in favor of...
I don't really know but my hunch would be that he's doing it for you. Or he might just forget and leave it on all the time (That's me. Haha). If you really want to know, just ask him - Awesome..the...
It would probably at least make him smile - I've just heard the joke too many times. Also, it's a bit impersonal...as in, humor is great, but it works better in contexts where it's an inside joke - a...

Couple things:   Yes, this would be an issue for me. I wouldn't be that comfortable with beginning a relationship right as I head away on an extended time away. LDRs are very difficult to maintain...
Me too, to be perfectly honest. Personally, I think you've done plenty. If a guy is too passive to make a move when a girl is making herself clearly available, he's not ready, not interested, or is...
These aren't examples of friendly teasing. These are examples of insensitive bullying. My mother used to say, It's only a joke if everyone is laughing. I think that holds true. Of course, sometimes...
He will. You'll get the un-airbrushed truth. And he'll blush deep-red while delivering it to you. If that appeals to you, by all means. It won't hurt your chances with him - it might embarrass both...
I'd look at the context and the tense he used to say too busy. Did he say he has been too busy? If so, don't worry a bit about it - that's just a canned excuse for being single in the past(which...

I dish it, take it, dish it back. Don't think this has much to do with type - more, whether or not the person is accustomed to friendly teasing growing up. If not, they might take it as a sort of...
On a side note, if it doesn't work out.... :blushed: :laughing:  I kid, I kid. You sound like a very caring and considerate woman. Your ISTJ is a lucky man. Keep up the good work!
I think it's a bit of a two-sided coin for us - we're either completely opaque about our problems, or we're extremely direct. It can be a bit of a shock to people when it's the latter, but that's...
Yeah - the 'friend zone' might be the death zone for other types - for us, think of it as our 'comfort zone.' We don't tend to date outside the comfort zone unless we're desperate or Cupid is on the...
One might say this is also true for certain non-religious people as they often place significant trust in scientific naturalism (which is basically metaphysics meets science, absent observational...
Absolutely this:     Beyond that, it depends on the stress - if it's work related, I put all my time and energy into making the cause of that stress go away (i.e. a task that needs to be...
I want to say this in the nicest way possible, but this is something you should absolutely talk to him about. You (especially him) both need to learn to communicate with each other - all...
Not sure I can help you understand him, but one thing to keep in mind is that ISTJs tend to look for clarity in relationships. Personally, I get the feeling he's changed his mind about you about 3-4...
I think an ISTJ would be driven to resolve the issue in one of two directions - stabilize the relationship (talk about the issue, see a counselor, etc...fix the issue), or break it off. One of our...
Honestly, I have virtually no idea - this doesn't sound much like ISTJ behavior to me. How does your friend feel about him? It could be that there's somewhat of a relationship imbalance where one...
Eh...I doubt it. We ISTJ guys aren't the flighty/whimsically-flirtatious type who run off with every girl who shows direct interest. If he likes you, he's not going anywhere - he just may take...

I agree! All this politically correct bullying/nit picking is a pet hate of mine.  From my experience, ISTJ- ISTJ would lose interest in each other/ be a bit freaked out and not be sure why!

You're an introvert.  Generating enthusiasm for the sake of conversation is not among your talents.  It's not as complex as people try to make it seem.
ENFs are good at talking and giving the illusion that what they have to say is important.

Dear INTP,  I hope you snap out of your mental state soon.. kinda hurts to see you like that. Cheer up. There are more things in life to worry about, don't let a few small encounters bring you down...
I have an INTP friend, and the way we think is very different (haha duh). For both of us, the thinking preference is preferred over the feeling. But -.- it feels as if it would have been easier if I...
Hey guys! I think some of you might remember me posting bout going out (as in literally. not boy girl go out) with an intp. And you guys said that he might like me and i might like him without...
Ah.. I get annoyed when ppl tweak stories/truth or exaggerate so that it sounds More interesting. In short that's lying isn't it. And I don't like it when ppl insult you just to make themselves feel...
I don't get this part about INTPs. Are INTPs naturally nice or mean. ._. Cause well they can be mean.. But they Mirror others behavior, and hope to please people? Ah confusing . And I don't get how...
Lol why do you say that?
Haha yeah..
Perhaps. (:
Haha nah.. I don't want to be in a relationship with him. I'll like him (and perhaps confirm this feeling?) then I'll see what happens a few years from now. Things do change
LOL. No evidence. Anw even if there is.. Isn't it super difficult to tell if he even likes anyone.. So I wouldn't know. But from my gut instinct! He doesn't.
Hmm.. No not really. He probably doesn't like me. So it's just one-way. The butterflies go on and off. Feelings take too much time for me to invest into.  but I'm super happy. LOL.
Think the butterflies came back...

That's a really good thread. No joke. Does my introverted feeling make me very slow to my feelings? Well I don't feel a butterfly WOOSH thing anymore. So I probably dont like him.
freakk.. I really don't know. What does it mean to like someone anyways? Such a confusing topic. Sighh.. Sorry guys.. I really didn't mean to lie. I just don't know.
-___- It's really difficult to determine romantic feelings.. isn't it, unless it's official. I thought you guys will be able to understand this better, since you guys are thinkers..
but we don't have mutual friends.. that'll be even more awkward. You guys don't believe me too.. -___-
That's actually kinda true. If it's not official we're just close friends right..
.__. I really dont know. Perhaps it hasn't registered to Me?
Nope. It means just sitting there and doing nothing. Like a stone. (:
Thats not true.. I do post on istj's forum.
I've stopped my obsession. Really think i don't like him now..
'eddie' sounds cute. LOL. Ohh.. I fantasize a lot too. Ah i guess i could have liked him before, without knowing.. Even with all those factors..
Oh i used to obsess over him. But that doesn't mean that i liked him or anyth.
So you actually feel a tangible feeling in your chest whenever you see her?
Isn't that just like any other friendship?
are you serious? Thats really news for me. I don't even know.. How do you guys know anw? The butterfly feeling? Lol
What? No! LOL! I can't solve it in 20s. Ill take at least a minute. And it's such a long time since i've played with one. Plus it's only the 3x3x3 one that i can solve. XD
Haha almost every other day. Just that we don't talk because it'll mean going out of our way and it's just too intentional.
Solving is not the difficult part. (: solving it quick is cooler. Like in 20s? (:
I thought that it's because they don't even know whether they like anyone..
Think we're gonna study together. Anw he might suddenly not want to go at the very last minute cause the scenarios played in his head are just too awkward. Haha. So maybe we won't meet up after all....
Ah i don't know. Really dislike thinking about such things.. Makes Me all confused.. Sorry..  Anw even if he does like me he'll avoid it. Self-denial should be good for both of us. (:
I'll bring some rubiks cube for him to fiddle around with. LOL. HAHAHAHAHA!
.________________. Uh.. If he does like me and i like him.. I guess we just don't know. It usually takes me 6 months after i stopped liking the person to realise it. Sometimes i don't even realise....
Oh. Nono i didn't think that it meant 'i dont care'. I understan what you've been saying. (: and im hoping that it'll be not as awkward as im imagining it to be.. We haven't even spoken in reality....
What? ._. I'm not investing too much in this emotionally.. It's just really awkward and i just wanna meet up even if it gets bad. And i'm really pretty sure we don't like each other. Last time i...
ahh maybe he's going. AGHHH! so awkward..
