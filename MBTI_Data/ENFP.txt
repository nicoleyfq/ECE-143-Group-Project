Well after I've gone through ENFP I'm going to do the rest of the types so yeah this is just the first of many posts for all types.
If he's a hunter he's not an ENFP, if it's sport shooting maybe. Dunno about tough love though. We can easily motivate people to get things done
Why though? And does that actually mean there is no room for a relationship with one?

I must plead guilty to not getting out into the other forum pool often enough.  I have been making the rare appearance in ISTJ-land lately, though.
Deep thought is neither advised or encouraged in our sound bite society.    So who is going to bite the bullet and start the Deep Conversational Thread?  I nominate the OP.
My going theory was that it was the diabolical plan of an INTJ, so that we'd be distracted by the bright shiny object known as INTJ forum before ever finding our own!

That's fascinating. The one INTJ I know well seems to me to be uninterested when I get long-winded, like he's just humoring me sometimes.

How does one smell like a big one? owo
Oh come on, have more confidence in yourself!
We're getting there.  Let's make this thread dirtier.
Odd question, but does he find you too wild or 'unstable' in our ENFP ways for his tastes?  And if the ISFJ is more short tempered, what was it that held them together?
Yeah and saying ESTPs are 'logical' and ENFPs are 'emotional' are basic, cliche MBTI stupidity.  One of my acquaintance definitely likes to to talk a lot, but don't seem to care when I'm the one...
Ohhhhhhh dear, we're back to square one with the stereotypes.  I'm surprised ESTPs are lurking on this thread. What were you curious about?

I've always been told I'm rather low maintenance. On dates, I'm usually the one paying for both myself and the guy. :tongue:

And I'm surprised that ENTP is pretty popular. I would think Ne doms would eventually sizzle out.
Holy shit, every option has at least one vote lol. And INFJ is more popular than INTJ? Mindblown! :crazy:  Who voted for ESTP?  What was the relationship like?

No, because we have a good idea of what it means.  xNFPs have a high capacity for smiling or acting like loonies around family and friends for fun. I take it with a grain of salt. ;)

Based on this thread, there seems to be a consensus that tests range from unreliable to pretty much bad as an indicator of actual type.   Now let's talk about your experience. What type are you?...
They're about 50% reliable or less.

I prefer to think of it as SJs being stuckup ninnies. :p
The Punisher is ISTP, with a stressed inferior Fe.  Mystery, hmm... possibly INTJ.
Socionics types. The key is dom function -> aux function -> orientation (so LSI would be TiSe, or Logical Sensory Extrovert, ISTj -- SEE would be SeFi, or Sensory Ethical Extrovert -- ESFp).   But...
Jon Stewart is an ENTP with an overblown tertiary Fe -- possibly INFJ. Colbert seems like another ENTP.
That kind of was the point.

Not really; ISTPs are F-inferior.
Ashton Kutcher's ENTP, McCartney's ESTJ. The rest are either correct or I don't know them.
ENTJ is most plausible off the above (ENTP is dumb -- no Ne in evidence), but his philosophy is fucked-up Ni + Fi. Methinks he's ISFP.   Again, no Ne in evidence. I think he's a cool cat ESTP...
That's Socionics Fe. Jungian Fe is more about beliefs externally sourced; of which the Joker naturally has none. He's ENFP; seeking to sow chaos and mayhem in society because he deeply believes...
Aggressive corresponds better to 8 and ENTJ. Vigilant is more cp6-ish, though it's probably the best fit type for 8w9.  Archetypically, Vigilant is ISFP cp6w5 > 8w9 > 3w2 sx/sp.
ENFP ENFj-Ni s|L|UAI 7w6 > 4w3 > 9w1 sp/so.  You remind me a lot of myself.
Ozzy's glaringly Se, just for starters. I think he's ISFP.

1) HE IS NOT DR WHO! *rages* 2) He isn't ENTP. Eleven is, but that's one Doctor.  The Joker's another ENFP. Why do people have so much damn trouble with the idea that Fs can be assholes?
Sounds quite a bit more Ti than Ne, but it fits ENTP.
The physical aspect of that is being overdone a bit. Rather, an Se-dom would quickly review all the options readily available to solve the problem and then get to solving it using whatever's at hand,...
Actually that's precisely what ENFPs do. ENFPs, being driven centrally by Fi, are very strongly ethically driven; idealists who employ whatever means at their disposal to make their beliefs,...
Okay, both of you are typed correctly. Let's see what BroNerd responds.
I've heard many type her as INFJ. Both typings are pretty bad, and likely predicated on people not realizing to what extent ISFPs seem N-like.
He is NOT an ENTP, though that might be slightly better than the usual ESTP.  He's ISFP. That, or ENTJ.
Bill Hicks is a very glaring ENFP.
In what sense?
The Doctor is ENFP. And even then only like half of his incarnations are ENFP -- Eight is clearly ENFJ, and Seven is clearly INTJ, just to name two.
Obviously they had free will, or they'd not have been able to do something that God expressly forbade.

Maybe because they have personality disorders creating interferences in the diagnosis. I think Jung wrote something along the lines of what I wrote.
Is it true that INTPs tend to forget what they just done the last day?

I tend to be distant when I really like someone if I don't know if the feelings are reciprocated.  INTJs give little to no feedback, followed by frequent criticism, especially at times when I am...
This sounds like BS to me....most of the smart people I know are also somewhat attractive.  However, I will say that a great mind is much more attractive than good looks, at least to me.

I'm curious, how long ago did you discover personality types and such?
I don't think INFJs should have to apologize for being overprotective. It stems from an incredibly deep level of both caring and devotion, which I think overshadows any negative affects of being...
Well, read more Jung. That should change your mind.
Well if typology was based on what was considered most intuitively appealing it would be within the realm of philosophy, but we are talking about a form of science, psychology.

Yeah, I can see how you would think that. I'm not sure what you took. Probably the MBTI, they are only A and B answers, but there are 4 sets of questions 20 each for N/S, F/T, and J/P. and 10 for the...

Yeah essentially! ENFPs tend to be the most 'Introverted of the Extroverts' so a lot of the time they tend to get mistaken to be INFPs a lot!
Okay, going by that comment and the other comments on this thread, I think I'm going to have to also agree for the moment and type him as a ESFP!
This one is a bit of a shot in the dark, But can he sometimes seem a bit introverted at times? like will he take moments to have time by himself?
I mean, I tend to wear a lot of pastels (mainly pink and white) and girly cute things but I will wear different things but In my own style, Idk :S

Thanks for your opinion but this is directed to those who came to the conclusion they are INFP and why they think they are.
Yeah, in the back of my mind I know I shouldn't care about it. And the truth is when it comes down to it I resist being labeled so it's kind of strange but I'm enjoying it for the time being.

I was on OKC for years - sadly it's not the norm. That's pure double Ne you see there. I met my current bf on there, but he was a 98% match. I'd be scared of a 47% match.
oh god so true.
lol. sounds like a conversation between me & my ENTP bf. I guarantee you if they didn't know what Ne-dom was they went and googled it and now possibly know more about it than you :p we are curious...
I think there are people of every belief that try to force their views on others. I would certainly never try to do that.
IMHO INFPs are the ultimate hippie. I have three in my family alone. SO CRUNCHY OMG.

Long and short answer: You are not ready for any kind of long-term commitments at this point in your life. I always find it best to let someone know this at the start so they know where I stand.
Hmmm, you may be correct, but how well was psychoanalysis working before CBT? From my understanding, not so well because the phobias were not really understood all that well in the first place.

I'm the same way in most situations, but I've found one type of scenario that I feel like I don't know how to handle: work. Even if I don't like or care about the person, I can't just ignore them...

Lol wut? Are you talking to us? I feel like ENFPs, or at least myself and the ENFPs I know, are absolutely flooded with self-issues and doubts. We are Fi-users, after all, and we take ourselves way...
On a side note, I wish current ISTP boyfriend was into MBTI like y'all are. :unsure:

Hello ENTJs! I have wandered over to your part of the jungle (careful with those teeth D:) in order to inquire how an ENFP could snag herself an ENTJ coworker. I'm coming to you folks because you...
Hmm, interesting. I think that was the case with one of the guys, but the other guy was obviously very sexually attracted to me and seemed to like being around me. I think he was just immature.
Welcome, fellow ENFP! Lol, it's creepy, I feel I could have written this XD *hugs*  Let's skip the small talk! What do you believe is your main purpose in this life? What were you put on earth to...
Ha ha! I should have clarified that my INTJ friend is of the female variety, and I'm looking for a male INTJ specimen ;)  Also, I think she's half cat. Not sure yet!
Hmmm, that's interesting. As an over-emotional ENFP, I usually *like* having calm people around me during difficult situations. If he were trapped in a car full of ENFPs, they'd be crying, panicking...
Where would I find your sexy male INTJ brethren in Chicago? :3 You introverts make yourselves hard to find! XD
OMGOMG I love INFJs and I love your insightful, deep questions! Can we be besties? *puppy dog eyes* As an ENFP, I am magnetically drawn to you folks. And I would totes love to share creative writings...
Hi hubcap! I live in the Midwest, too. In Chicago, so the metropolitan feel makes it a bit less Midwesterny (not so much mom hair around here XD). What brings you to the Midwest, and how do you like...
Hi Zaiya! Nice to meet you. What kind of kitty cat do you have?  I'll bake a cake with you! What kind of cake? My real life INTJ friend and I once made an orange rum cake. It was very good! Though...
Hello, fellow ENFP! How are you doing today? :3
Hi Torrnickel! *waves* I'm an ENFP, so I guess not much for adding variety XD. What brought you to the PerC forums?  What are your hobbies? Besides slowly and subtley taking over the world, of...
Ha ha! You guys are a riot :)   I'm actually an ENFP! But my mom's an ISTP, so she'll join your party!
Ha ha, there's the ENFP general idea thing going. Not so much a details person, but I'll try. I'm talking specifically in regards to romantic love. I've had some pretty crappy experiences where a)...
*cries sensitive NF tears*
Yes!!! This is exactly what I'm referring to! It's like, I'm naturally flirty, how do I up the ante from my natural flirtyness for someone I'm truly interested in? I mean, I even am flirty with...
Hello INTJs! I figure you guys are the ones most likely to take a scientific approach to dating, so this ENFP's curious: how do you approach dating? Do you feel you utilize your NT logic? And, if...
Oh, thanks for the tip! What kind of test do you recommend using?    T'is a pleasure to meet you, good sir! I like what you had to say about connections in life and valuing the few, precious...
I normally get ENFP as my test results, but according to the Jungian cognitive functions test, I have a lot of Fe. Weird, I know XD
Awww, you guys should try to meet some NFs, especially ENFJs. Or, really, any type with a highly developed Fe (ENTPs work, too). Personally, as an ENFP (with a lot of Fe), I try to include everyone....
Awww, thank you! I think he's just really confused. He's also 22 years old, so it could just be a maturity thing? I did have fun talking to him about my crazy invention ideas. Like a portable butt...
I shall take you up on your suggestion! Awww, don't be sad! I love you INFJs; I just think this guy was a borderline T or something. He seemed more married to his work than open to dating, which is...
Ha ha, I tried a male INFJ, but he was a little too serious for me. On the first date, he asked me how many children I wanted O_o. Is that a typical INFJ thing?  Also, he admitted he didn't really...
Hi Boheme! A very fitting username for an INFP :)  Welcome to this forum. I hope you get the feedback you're looking for!
Hello fellow ENFPs! So, embarrassing as it is to admit, I don't know how to flirt with guys I actually like (I'm 24 and never been in a relationship T_T). I'll do a little ENFP flirting with people...
OMG, you folks are every bit as amazing as the INFPs I know in real life <3  I hope this letter gave you a confidence boost, because you deserve it! I see all the things you do for people that go...
Hi Lisa,  No, you're definitely not in the wrong group! There are a great many ENFPs here :) Aw, rescue dogs are very sweet, but they do tend to scare easily! Mr. Cheetos sounds like a cutie pie....
I've never actually met an INTP before! What are you folks like? :)  You can have baskets and rainbows, moonlight_echo! Just no NT experiments on the kittens XD
Awww, no offense meant, disguise! I actually quite adore ENTPs; in fact I got my heart broken by an ENTP this week :( Perhaps you could restore my faith in ENTPs by reminding me of all your wonderful...
Aww, I love the name Belladonna! Reminds me of this song:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pxD5xmHwGw  Thank you! My hair's colored ombre, so brown on top and lighter blonde at the bottom. I'm...

Exactly. I so highly value my reputation of being someone who is good and trustworthy, that being falsely accused of something would devastate me.
I would have a serious problem. It would hurt my feelings deeply that someone thought I was capable of this bad thing I had supposedly done. I would do everything in my power to prove my innocence in...
I'm a Pisces. So Pisces it's not even funny.....
maybe not so much my friends, but in partners, I tend to go for the wounded types...I'm all my love can heal your wounds!!!! I guess I have a Savior Complex or something. Any other ENFPs like that?...
Guilty. :blushed::laughing:
and I accidentally hit E instead of I, so it's a tiny bit skewed....:blushed:

Oh we got along fabulously when I was in high school and she was in complete control (straight A's, never acted out, never did a bad thing EVER). But even though I still live at home, it's not as...
I guess all that's left is to decide how much you're willing to take. Whether or not this is a dealbreaker for you. If he's not willing to change, you'll just have to either put up with it or leave....
An ENFP would walk through the woods ALONE!?! :shocked::wink:
:( that is a problem. I'm sorry that he isn't more respectful of your opinions/feelings.
Aww. Just knowing that there is someone else out there who has been in the same situation (freakishly similar, actually! WEIRD!!! HAHA!) makes me feel better. At least I am not a terrible...
The timing of these conversations is very important, too. If you ask him to rephrase when he's already upset, he won't react favorably--he'll likely want to rebel, which is what it sounds like he's...
OOOOOO!!!!!! Is this ok to do!?!?! I have been wanting to ask my ISTP if when he needs alone time he can just say, I need to be alone rather than, I don't want company. Because the latter makes...
You're welcome. And I know it must hurt your feelings, but I doubt that is his intention. Try not to take it personally (very much easier said than done, I know). (((HUGS)))

My ISTP kissed me first...and it was awesome. We were watching a movie at his place, and he just turned to me, scooped me up in his arms, and kissed me. GREAT first kiss. But I'm sure he wouldn't...
I think it must have been written about an ISTP :laughing:
There are times when I see a look in his eyes that looks like love to me. I think he is beginning to love me, even though he may not have even realized it himself yet. But I don't care how long it...
We've been seeing each other for a little over 4 months, but we work together and have been acquaintances for almost 2 years (he got my number and started texting me in August, we started hanging out...
I sent him this one in reply.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjsjZWlRVvo

Our brains work the same way and we understand where the other person is coming from and vice versa. It's rare and wonderful to be understood in such a way. But I couldn't handle an ENFP romantic...
I didn't vote in your poll because I'm not INTJ, but I got a 7. ENFP gets a 7!?! I guess we're not all warm and cuddly afterall.....*evil laugh*:laughing:
You and I are the same on this--I tend to see it as more merciful (that word makes me sound conceited....) to just be up front with someone if I'm not interested, rather than string them along just...
That is SO true. It's torture for us, especially if we are interested in you but don't know how you feel about us. We struggle with building up fantasies in our minds that often times have nothing to...
This happens to us a lot, actually. Part of it comes from us being oblivious to reading your signs. But, unfortunately, if she said she just wanted to be friends when you called your movie a...
My mother is ESFJ and we have some serious relationship problems. She is very manipulative and controlling, but with her weak intuition, she can't see it at all, so I see no chance of her changing...
IMO a potential false positive mostly comes with an ENFP not being romantically interested in someone. If I like someone just fine as a friend, but I feel that he is interested in me in a romantic...
ISTP is where it's at. :laughing:

It's strange to me that having bad posture would have anything to do with being an ENFP. I have good posture!

As you put it, it's endearingly adorkable. Very cute! :)

That's really true actually, I can see how certain ENFJs could use their skills for manipulation. This ENFJ I was talking about, come to think of it, can lie very easily and even with some flair....
Failure is just not an option for me. At all costs I will succeed.
For me quality time and physical affection would be of equal importance. The others I can actually do mostly without, or I guess I just don't require them as much lol.

Thank you for the advice pockyist!  She usually calls me every morning and didn't, should I wait a couple of days before talking to her or proceed to speak with her now.

ISFJ. They love comfort, if my mom is any indication.   TMLT eat cereal for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
ENTJ.  TLMT want to be a real superhero.
ENFP. Just because I relate so well to that.   TMLT to meticulously take care of their lawn.
Maybe ESXJ because of their leaning toward more traditional systems?   TMLT to spend a lot of money on home decor.
INFJ.  TMLT to try and rescue every abused animal they see.

It sounded kind of stupid when I reread it, but I still think so, that it's ridiculous that he would complain about this, about his friend not being loyal, when he's being hurtful in a very passive...
If he won't say this to you, then it's kind of like he's leading you on...from the outside it looks like he wanted to keep your affection for him, without saying yes or no...he wasn't being honest on...
hmm I'm an INFJ, so I think you might be half way from achieving that look :) JK! well that's one way to attract me, but you should really ask other INFPs for insight...
He reminded me of an INFP guy I once dated, so his image stuck with me for INFPs...he looked like a stoned intellectual Jesus :) I mean it in a good sense of course, I like that look...
For me getting to that quick conclusion is the same as watching a movie, and spotting the director only by it's style... I could say that it was the lighting or the dialogues that made think so, but...
No comment at all - being ignored...being so insignificant to someone, that they completely gave up on me...and won't even try to talk about changes with me...

I am EXTREMELY interested in the spiritual journey of ENFPs. I do better talking than typing, so I made a video. You can respond on this forum or on the video itself.  Warning: I do say um and...

I don't know if any of you have had experience with this, but I have some things to confess.  I think I'm turning out to be one of those bad ENFP's. Not malicious or manipulative... just sexually...

Intellectual stimulation. Emotional stimulation. They are just as much a turn on as physical stimulation. Just keep it healthy, growing, and real.

I'm straight.  However, I do sometimes feel a tiny bit of attraction to women. Women's bodies are beautiful. Their minds are beautiful too.  But sorry women, men are way too amazing.  Wow.
My friends see me with a tall, dark, handsome man who loves books and art and is a little bit shy, but mostly engaging and kind.  Exactly what I'm looking for and can't find.
I was scared of my 1st grade teacher. She was way too strict. Haha. I protected my little emotional self by not raising my hand; the possibility of being humiliated was too much for me! After 1st...

ENFPs are sexy.... just.... I wouldn't want to date an ENFP myself :)
I take that back. I'm glad the West has less ENFP's. That means that we most likely have more of the other, sexier types. And it just makes us Wild West ENFP's even more special!!

INFPs: fifty ideas, but not a single word written down.
The ENTP has run out of sensible things to say: I'm flabbergasted. *sarcasm*
True.
If Adam were an ISTP, God would've kicked him out of paradise for being one.
Well, we have a community centre thing around here, and pretty much the only place to go to is the library. I've always considered libraries to be more of a safe haven of whispers and quiet, so that...
Book sale cart. Paperbacks going at a rate of twenty-five cents. My weakness.  Yes, the library here sells books.
If Adam were an ISTP, the human race would've never existed.
Maybe if you looked at what happened five minutes ago, you'd realize exactly why you're falling down to your death, ISTP.

Omg XD Mysticism abounds in ENFPs as well then, I presume. I have two decks of Tarot cards and a book on interpretation. I do use these regularly, of course, but don't ask me to do readings on you...
Seriously though, are you having an identity crisis? XD

ENFPs: the only type willing to criticize themselves and fail at it badly. Wonder what that says about us...  ESFP, stop cutting in line.
And INTPs can't even tell you what happened in the last ten minutes because they were too busy playing the new Assassin's Creed.
Wow, an INTP who doesn't like themselves. Why am I not surprised?
You poor thing. When was the last time you went on a date?
ESFP, have you ever even changed a lightbulb?
INTJ, if you didn't recognize it yet, I have a little function called extraverted thinking. If you're mistaking Te for rage, methinks your Te is underdeveloped. *_*  ISTP, are you sure? I swear the...
ISTP, there's people who actually want to do that with you? Wow.
ISTP, ask not whether an ENFP can slow down for you, but ask yourself whether you can keep up with the ENFP.

Yes, ENTJ, we can actually  think factually. Have you ever considered that you're the one with your facts mixed up?
Sounds good--but I thought this was a criticism thread XD
I'm probably not the best person to reply in this thread, as I happen to be biased.
INTJ, have you actually considered the fact that we may actually care about ourselves and you as well, or do I need to take a hammer to your self-esteem and nail it to your brain?    We're...
Uh, the reason we keep asking is because you remembered to bring all the books to the study session, but you only have one of your shoes on. Take better care of yourselves, INTJ, and maybe we won't...
Am good at persuading people verbally, not so much in the written word--but then, the words tumble out easier when I'm writing.

You should check out Ladyhawke and The Naked & Famous then ... both sweet bands from downunder :)

Thats true, but can you actually go from being cute to hot? I'm 27 and most people think I'm about 18. Until recently, I could pass as a 14 year old. You'd think I was short or something, but I'm 5'8.

Enfpleasantly ain't nothin' wrong with that! In all seriousness though... a little mess = a lot of fun.  juliana333 I know! List making is literally addictive, and I know exactly what you mean with...
DandyAndCheese yay, thanks! I know there's no way an internet survey can specifically pinpoint *the* career for a person, but I'm hoping more people at least find it interesting! (:
Aw, you're welcome! :)
I decided I like you already because of the title of this thread and your username.  Hi, welcome!   What makes you think that your border between TJ and FJ?
Meditation read as medication the first time. Oh gosh.   I can see how fully charged could relate to appearing high sometimes. For me, I'm usually very quiet and focused when I'm on. Off topic...
Well, maybe it isn't type-specific.   Do any of you darling ENFPs go through periods where it feels impossible to be productive? How do you get through it? Some days I feel so energized. I'm...
Jeans, chinos, trousers, corduroys, jeggings... anything with a zipper and button sucks.  I'm all about shorts and leggings. Sometimes yoga pants.

Professor XX,   It is my opinion that through indirect and direct observation, my opinion of your level of sanity is arguably lower than most. You seem to feel that your level of maturity...
This is a really interesting idea to toss around.   I can't speak for every ENFP, but I want to say that a lot of us would consider ourselves to have more than one purpose. I'd go even deeper by...
Welcome! There are definitely a lot of interesting threads around here.
I think Cinna is an ENFP!   Definitely ENFJ for Peeta like NerdyCool5EVAH said. [Book] Gale seems like ESFP because of his questionable logic and overall attitude.
Writ same here. Engineering has the best career security contingent on the trend of hiring being done by companies like Ford... and college tuition. I wish I had put as much effort into math as...
The INTX falls into a certain typecast. Even though villains can be extroverts, I think there's a sort of beautiful insanity that happens in good writing where introverts have this compelling and...
Get $4 of my own money and put it in the register. The circumstance would be different if I were another customer waiting in line, but altruism only goes so far when your job is at risk. I'm the type...
That's pretty interesting. I think the cliche don't judge a book by its cover is perfect for ENFPs. Giving the illusion of being open isn't necessarily easy. A lot of people get defensive if you...

Joking about suicide or pretending to have those thoughts can spiral out of control rapidly. That needs to be addressed.

In AP Euro and every other history class I've taken, when France is initially mentioned, it's always about the revolution in the 1790s. I love how Les Mis is about the uprising of 1832, which feels...

Hey DMack, thank you! haha *partyparty*
Hi there :) I love Glee too. Probably way too much. Klaine is adorable, and I love Chris and Darren in real life.
Hi! I just wanted to say I love your avatar & your relationship sounds freakin' cute. Yay for being new!
Oh gosh, this thread makes me feel so ugly!   Keria Knightley is stunning, and she's witty too. :)

This is so great that you're coming to this so early! Really. One thing I'll add, just for what it's worth, along the lines of paying one's dues (which is a really mature and realistic...
We are totally of the same ilk! I have three people who work directly for me, but I give pause at how to refer to them--our group, our office, etc., because I dislike the sense of ownership. My...
This isn't my regular type of post at all, but I'll consider it a PSA: For those being brutalized by cleanings that involve fear, intense pain, and a lot of blood, I have three words: Find Another...
This is such an accurate summation of this. It's not like I'm bottling up bad feelings and thoughts about people, but all of a sudden I'll decide that it's just been too much. I do have a limit, but...
I agree--angelcat summed it up beautifully! I always say that it can be confusing being me, because I always see at least two outcomes. Being hyper-aware of another side or possibility is what keeps...
Ditto! Just had to say, the type theory may come in time! At first, my INTP husband was totally put off by it, thinking it would be totally confining and narrow. When I finally got him to read a...
I'm out of my depth, and will let the pros and/or ENTPs here field this. But, to clarify, I don't at all have to experience something to want it fixed in society. I don't know any soldiers but I...
I agree that for ENFPs this is probably less gender-based than personality-based, even though I'm not a guy... However, I've been described (by an ENTJ no less!) as the most analytical person I've...
There are a ton of people here who are so much better at describing this than I am--but, alas, I totally understand the challenge so will give my two cents. At work, I'm very pragmatic (as I say, I'm...
I'm sure I've said this in other threads, but, for what it's worth... Ns, especially NPs (read, me!) can really drive Ss, and especially SJs, crazy. So this is not a one-way street and it has nothing...
I don't have any sage input but my husband (INTP) and I met at work and to this day he has been my favorite work partner, if you will. It was the perfect compliment. We both want to get stuff done...

I SO agree with this! I worked with an ISTP for many years and we had an amazing, mutually synergistic working relationship. I think it's probably fairly universal that ENFPs will generally get on...
Just had to say this is hilarious--a regular saying of mine is, I have the attention span of a goldfish right now!
When people say that not having kids is selfish, or that you'll regret it in the end (and all the other pablum that's doled out--ugh!), I always say, People should have kids because they want them,...
Here are a few thoughts, just for you think about. People are certainly unique, and we all vary even where we are on the continuum (i.e., 50%/50% T & F vs. 90% F). So, as they say, results may vary....
A big factor as we get older is to weigh our need for impulsiveness against our long-term values and goals. I've been at my current job since 2001. (Yikes!) I of course intended only to be there a...
I SO agree with this! I hate shopping, think fashion is fairly dumb (why on earth would I change the length of my skirt annually because I'm told to?), and wear pretty much grays and blacks, with a...
ENFPs see the potential in people/relationships/situations. Against all odds, they can hold on, hold out, keep trying harder, and keep forgiving. There can be the thought that if they keep working...
I believe people should have children because they genuinely want them, not because society expects everyone to procreate. I knew in my early 20's that I didn't want children. (A few years to go...
I say the exact same thing! Hilarious. I'm fairly alone with the sentiment (especially after this winter--best winter ever!).   The snow makes me crazy happy. The particular quiet that blankets a...
I work with a ton of SJs and I often can't believe my train of thought when they're babbling at me. Spot on! You have no idea who I am. I also start thinking things like, I am SO bored, I don't...
I agree about the questions. When I tested people myself I used fewer questions and tossed out the ones that feel too confining or odd.
Once I delved into this a bit more, I learned that there are actually two types of visual learners--visual-verbal (language one sees/reads) vs. visual-non-verbal (pictures and diagrams one...

Remember, MBTI functions are about preference, not behaviour. Depending on your job, environment, group of friends, etc, you can act 'non-ENFPish' and still have those same preferences. :)

Haha oh man i've been gone a few months but I see that the ENFP/INTJ love fests are still going strong lol.    I know one confirmed INTJ who's dating a friend ENFP of mine and they seem to get...

My last 2 bosses were my age and they couldn't understand why I didn't want to move up in the company. I just never want to be a manager. In my field of work, that's waaaaay too much responsibility....
I think it's because I trust who the person says they are. I don't think they have ulterior motives. I trust myself and am an honest person so I think others are the same. While I'm good at reading...
I only had like 2 b's. lol

My old boss is estj and I would laugh at how similar she is to my best friend who are both the same age. But the thing is, my old boss could never understand me. My best friend gets me better than I...
I could have written this question. I am also type 4. I definitely grieve the loss of the fantasy. It sucks so much when it doesn't work out. I don't think any of my potential relationships would...
When I was young and very insecure I was a major people pleaser ... but only b/c I needed external validation for my self worth. The older I get and the more mature I get, I find that I really don't...
My bestie is estj ... not sure how that happened. I like Ns as friends mostly. There's some kind of amazing connection that happens when we are together. i can spot an N just in body language. :P
I trust everyone. I'm too open. I idealize and fall in love too easily. *sigh* I don't know how to change.
As I said, the clue to knowing a projection has occurred is the peculiar feeling of intense fascination or obsession with a man whom she will feel is her ideal mate. He, of course, unless he has a...
Hmmmm, very interesting. I will have to google that ...
He says he always tests as intp but for some reason when he reads the descriptions he identifies with istp. We both agree he can't be defined! lol   He's really wonderful.

In his defense he went through a horrible divorce and once even told me that he doesn't trust love. I think maybe he wanted to have me and liked the idea of it, but the reality of it would have been...
True! :D

I don't pursue the reasons because I don't think it's a problem. I'm just not for them and they are not for me. :)
I have a weird dynamic with intj's. I think it's b/c my father is one. I am Daddy's little girl and we get along fabulously! So ... whenever I meet a male intj I revert back to almost being like a...
Quick thinker here. Sometimes I say/type things and then have to back track or re-read to see if it makes sense. If I am talking I almost always have to ask: Does that make sense? If it doesn't...
Wow! All of the signs are there. Don't think about it, just be a man and go for it. Don't hesitate and overthink things as you intjs tend to do.
Yeah, sometimes. Then people invasively ask me for my thoughts bc I'm normally so carefree and bubbly. It's annoying because: A. I haven't processed them yet to know what to say or how to explain...
lol ... comparing that answer to all the enfps. :P
I agree .... tragicomedy. Hoping the ending will be happy though! *sigh*
[QUOTE=Space Ryder;22523666]Yeah.   Like this:  419978  That's funny! I mean I've rented apartments where people have died in them ... but they aren't haunted and I definitely didn't tell them...
lol!!!!!!
lol! Do you mean a specific apartment? I have never heard of such a thing!!!
End it. Sounds very, very unhealthy.
I would go back to being 10 years old, not gain weight, confidently deal with the bullies, shrug off the lack of love and affection from my parents and pursue my life's dream of being a singer! :D

I compare myself to my male esfp coworker. He is A LOT more emotionally driven than I am. He is also REALLY into working out and making himself as attractive as possible. He's very attention seeking...
I could care less if someone thinks I'm being fake or not. I know I'm not fake. I treat life organically, let things unfold. I never have a plan, I just respond authentically in every situation. So,...
Nope. No one needs unnecessary drama. I wouldn't shun them, but I wouldn't make them a priority in my life anymore.
Okay I had to think about this one bc there are not a whole lot of people I dislike. I guess if I didn't like someone they would see that I just tolerate them instead of being warm, friendly, open...
I'm about to have the absolute most perfect date ever in 4 weeks! He is taking me to the Florida Keys and we are camping on the beach, going snorkeling, parasailing, jet skiing and kayaking!!!! But...
I wear dresses and dress very feminine. I love showing my curves! :D
Nope. Out of sight is definitely not out of mind! The love and caring will always be there, picking up right where we left off! Unless it was an awkward friendship/relationship and it was left badly....

WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 11 days?? I want to elope too! I think it's so romantic. :D
I'm really good at reading others UNLESS it comes to attraction. I don't know why, but I suck at knowing whether someone likes me or not. I ALWAYS think they do! Which is CLEARLY not the case! LOL ...
Can I answer 200 and be ok? It's just way too long.
ixtj for sure!
I actually like my negative traits. Is that weird?? I mean, it's certainly not convenient to be unorganized and bad with money ... but I am working on those things! I believe anyone can improve if...
Really good advice! :thumbsup'"

Why do you love your isfj and entp?  Sent from my Le X522 using Tapatalk
You never seen an ENFP when they go into hiding? What?  http://personalitycafe.com/istj-forum-duty-fulfillers/997722-im-enfp-flipping-into-istj.html

Gah. I sent the INTJ ex a message. As short and to the point and with as little BS as possible and written with the help of another xNTJ friend. He's under no obligation to reply so that's very...

Because I'm that bored and you're the only one who was willing to entertain me. Even if it was just to troll. :wink:
From the way you've described it, it does sound exactly like a romantic relationship, only without the sexual parts. If you've never been in this kind of relationship then it's understandable that...
Welcome fellow ENFP! Yey! I hope you will like it here. :)
I love marathoning great movies/Tv-series as well. Or laying beside him/in his lap watching him play Xbox. Like GTA or Resident Evil. And I can take over when he has to get a drink or bathroom break....

I'm so bored, please entertain me.   Here, I'll start:   255746
So, silly question maybe, but are you in love with him? And if not, do you think he's in love with you? Because it sounds like the two of you are basically a couple, but without the sex.
Nothing! ISTJs are the cuteness. :wink:
Oh God I feel for you! My relationship has really been on the rocks lately as well and I'm having the same thoughts of what the heck to do with myself without him.   May i suggest Tinder, or...
Good luck! :)

It's not as black and white as that, it depends on the type. Certain types of Thinkers that use very little Fe can seem more immortal or cold, Fe Feelers usually won't. Sounds like Fe to me. Fi is...

You can't type yourself correctly by going off of stereotypes. Remember, your MBTI type only relates to about 10% of your personality and a lot of stereotypes are anecdotal and misleading. Proper...

Fantastic. Amazing. I feel like I could burst. :crazy:
So much popcorn, too little time.
But in my opinion, MBTI personality type doesn't correlate with physical appearance, and it doesn't define someones attitude. :S
Of course we are. Trust me, I'm a Deity. Never doubt yourself. :tongue:

Concerned about a project I have to complete.   My project partner is practically non-existent so I have to finish this thing by myself during my lunch break. :frustrating:
I'm a Deity, so I'm as valuable as they get.  But this thread seems a little silly.  You can't say that one personality type is destined to make more money than another.

Oh, I didn't get the memo. :P  Doesn't go too good with her 'mafia' image anyways, so I like it. :D

Mafia? Since when did you turn mafia, dollie? ;)    Who were these 3 people, pray? :D    Why you scared of Dollie? She is sweet. And harmless. Like a dairy cow. :D xD

Being an ENFP, I myself am often surprised by our shameless flirtation. :D But honestly, I love it at the same time. :laughing:
But do you agree that many introverts deem themselves more social after taking a shot or two? :)  What about all the other Ixxx here? What do you guys feel?
Oh you wouldn't know darling. :P  But generally, do you drink?  I wish to debate that most introverts are predisposed to drinking for socializing. :)
Depends on a few factors. One: How good did the mirror say you look? ;) Two: Any alcohol around? I won't drink, but litok and the other introverts could sure use a bottoms-up on hard liquor. :P...

He likely has other women, he definitely is used to getting what he wants, and no way is interested in anything meaningful.  I'll pass. Initiative and charm can be sexy, bossiness and manipulation...
I allowed for that, which is why I asked the cab driver if he was asking me out. The driver thought it was funny that I couldn't tell whether I was being hit on or not.   More importantly, when he...

I am a Virgo with Libra moon and Aquarius rising but I have always hated the Virgo descriptions!  I don't think they sound much like me at all!!:tongue:
I'm not really capable of hate I don't think, even when someone hates me.  I always see their good points as well as the bad ones and it is almost impossible for me to hold a grudge.
This is very helpful!  Thank you!:happy:  He always says he loves those things but sometimes I get to feeling otherwise or am unsure about his reactions.  He will go into lecture mode and I feel like...
Well....I sometimes idealize commitment and think how I can be so committed...and later find out otherwise, so I'm not gonna say that is my strong point.:blushed:

I have very vivid, very strange (according to my friend... I thought everyone had really weird dreams) dreams. We often talk about ours; hers usually involve people who are very familiar to her and...
You can be lying without knowing it yourself. It's a basic human need to want validation; people who claim they don't are not so much not human as probably out of touch with themselves.
Yes, I'm an ENFJ! I don't know very many people outside of the internet who are familiar with it. And you don't sound blunt at all. We all have something to share. :proud:
Judging by your description, I'd categorize you as an IxFP. As for the N/S thing... for sensors, the meaning is in the data. For intuitives, the meaning is the meaning, and the data all pitches into...
Welcome! I'm new too.
No, I'd have to agree with cali... teasing like that is, indeed, racist. It's racially insensitive even if it's not directly expressing a feeling of racial superiority.  To cali, I think being so...
Outside validation, and outside affirmation, is less biased than inward validation. It makes people feel more secure, which everyone wants to some degree.
I like to do calming things like listening to music, going for walks, exercising, or taking showers. You could do something that made you happy or makes you laugh, like watching funny movies. And...
I agree with a lot of things the OP said. I especially liked what you said about mental illness typing -- that's treading on some very dangerous territory, though things like music typing aren't...

Wow, that's a lot! Alright I'll sift through them after classes later, but before I do, I just have to ask... Are these English songs? :P That was the only thing about some of your contributions...
Done!
Your enthusiasm makes me glow with joy. :)   Also, if anyone has any song or category ideas, please share!
^That paragraph was a train wreck.
The majority of what's on the list were contributions in that other thread. I categorized all of those into everywhere but Melancholy, which only had two or three. So, my contributions are mainly in...
I'm sure you like the Bowie song, it was you who added it to the Theme Song thread! :)  And sure thing, you want those as two new categories?
I spent way too much time on this to not bump.  Bummmpppp
Hello friends! :) So I took the liberty of making a list and categorizing many of the songs posted in the ENFP Theme Song thread. I figured since we compiled it as a group, the likelihood of ENFPs...
Everything is essential, but nothing is really important. What I mean is, life is the most complex thing. As humans, we perceive life as humans do. Those who perceive differently are called holy or...

I make the same mistake. I think it's plurality confusion, as in the English language uses *'s* to make singular nouns into plural nouns. The mind might be associating the sentence with the rule of...
Exactly! Which I guess is why we read into it more when other people use them. How rude of him to say that! I totally would have called them 'our friends, etc. :)

Haha yes I do follow. Unfortunately I don't have much to add, however. I would just say that the emotions do exist when having sex on your own will, they just might be varying degrees of intensity?
Well I think you got the wrong idea. I did say to have sex responsibly, after all. Anyway, I think this is less about the different forms of sex and more about sex simply being a thing. Sure, you...
Sex is just so normal, so completely natural. Cats do it outside of our windows. Now, maybe we shouldn't be as impersonal about it as cats are, but it's not THE DEFINITIVE THING about living, so why...
Yes exactly! That's a terrifying thought. So that sucked... And this wedding ring isn't going anywhere... F***!
Now, do you think this is an ingrained fact of nature, or do you feel it's a preference of certain people who have learned to act in such a way? If the latter, what do you have to say about people...
Do you feel that that's natural?
Yes exactly. I've had love before sex and I've had sex before love. It ain't no thing. After all, it's our natural purpose to mate and bond with one another, and I don't think nature cares about the...

Thanks. Can you give me an example of how the enneagram helped you? It would really help me to understand it.  I disagree about your stance on the MBTI though - which aux and tertiary functions...
Why do you think it's a straight jacket more than the enneagram though? I'm not sure I can agree with that at all to be honest. You know your functions flip around when you are stressed and you rely...
This is exactly what I have found. I can just about see a tritype for myself but it really depends on my mood and where I am in my life at the time. Have you typed yourself in the Enneagram?

Thanks! That's a really good website. It's at least helped me to narrow it down a bit to 4,5 and 7. Think I had much more of type 2 in me when I was younger. I've read it's quite unusual for an ENFP...

No need to apologise. I enjoy MBTI puzzles. :)
I have a book on INFP as well somewhere I can dig out for you if you like from when I was trying to figure out if I was an ENFP or INFP. It gives a good cognitive function relationship overview. ...
Thing that makes me unsure about you being an ISFP is there's a definite Ne sense from you from you say, which would point to an xNFP type to me. I am very aware of Ne, since I'm a Dom. ISFPs don't...
Yeah I realised after I wrote it. I edited soon afterwards. I was trying to get across that I didn't detect much Se or Si in there from what she wrote. I agree there is lots of Fi in there.
You think you are an Se aux? That's sounds unlikely to me. See if the Si inferior resonates...  Si for ENFPs  Younger or more immature ENFPs...  Underdeveloped Si is the reason why you are...
No worries :) Introverted feeling can perhaps best be described as an ENFP’s digestive system. We take in experiences via our extroverted intuition, then process them and decide how we feel about...

His sister at one point was going through a bad divorce and what not. He told me, I just can't have fun knowing she's having such a bad time.
My ESFJ father figure feels bad if he has the chance to go out and have fun when he knows someone else is having a bad time.  I don't understand lol.
You sound like an ENTP to me. Ne can be confusing with Te but you said yourself you're more interested in the ideas than the actual implementation of them for the most part.
They both sound like ISFPs.

I'm ENFP with a half sleeve and a smaller forearm piece.  The friends of mine with the most tattoos are ENTJ, INTJ, xNFPs, and ESFP.
I'll usually try to find their dominant cognitive function first, it kind of all aligns in place after that usually.

I'm in the tech start up community where I live myself.  Read the biography, watch the movie, they're both good. I actually think iSteve with Justin Long was kind of funny lol.
No way he was either of those. My theory is he was an unhealthy ENFP with an Fi and Te loop. Making his functions Ne/Te/Fi/Si. His vision and creativity (Ne) was always being constantly rationalised...
ENTJ > ENTP > and with further reasoning ENFP.  When I took the test initially ENTJ with the whole Executive archetype appealed to me. I then looked into the J/P divide and realized there's no way...
Hey, I'm probably an ENFP just trying to fit in on the forum.
P's just know how to party.
I have two Ne dom teachers. And of course this is just a case by case basis, but mine even when they get off topic it's still somewhat relevant to the subject or material, and I can still grasp it...
You definitely have to know the person a decent amount, otherwise yeah you'll get the weird look haha.  They it eat it up! xD
Absolutely. My best friend is cognitively an ENTJ, however when I first typed him I was thinking about INTJ.  Cognitive functions are all different person to person, his Te is really constructive...
You mean the introverted judging functions with Ni and Si? You make a good point with Ti though too. Because honestly my INTP friend tells me that he represses his Ne aux with his Ti because he...
Personally I think Ne is the one that sticks out the most. I can usually tell once I start talking to them, there's just that weird rapid connection through ideas and concepts. I can almost tell...
Life is just all fun Don't get mad at me Duder I'm just living more.
Both of my last girlfriends were INTJs.  It made so much sense, especially with the connection I had with the first one that I just couldn't explain. Ni dom women make me blush haha.
20 years old, 17 people.  Ahahah, man I'm a whore.
Being an Ne dom I just can't even imagine being confused for being an Fe dom.  You might be confusing Fi for Fe in the sense that you want to create harmony with others, it's just how you go about...

This is the biggest misconception that I fell into as well. I mistook being a Thinker as compared to general intelligence. Your competency with puzzles like sudoku is because of Ne.  I feel like a...

Dear ISTPs,  Its my one-year anniversary of signing onto this site, today, Thanksgiving day.  Which was about the time I realized my ISTP love is ISTP.  Whom I met last October, after some years of...

This election - like about every other - is just a matter of who is less worse.
Dear ISTP,   Tomorrow its our to-the-day anniversary of when we met, after those years of writing.  It was that day I fell for you completely even though I did not want to.  That day everything...

Only sometimes. Less than half the time in fact, I believe, because there is a study published somewhere on percentages of that.  And there are other Socionics types an ISTP might be besides ISTp or...
Trust your ENFP intuition!  It really works! It is a very strong point for us.  ISTP is not working on intuition quite so much as you of course, and maybe thats a reason they need more time to be...

Well, I would say that a great example of an INFP game would be something like Life is Strange. Although I do not like where the last episode went, I do believe the game to contain a perfect...
Absolutely Beautiful. And incredibly fascinating!
I was tapping my feet and used it help me get my focus back to work on a project so I'm gonna go ahead and give it a 7/10. It's not what I'd normally listen to, but it was enjoyable and helped me to...
These are pretty darn good! Thank you! I've added quite a few of them! =)

The problem for me has been mixed signals.  I think for my friend, his entire life has been dedicated to building his professional and intellectual life.  Socially, romantically, he's the best and...
My INFJ and I aren't talking right now. He's been very hot and cold during our relationship 3 1/2-4 months), sometimes being the most loving nurturing person on earth and other times seeming almost...

Could not agree more.  There are a million ways to read various signs and then later you find out or figure out that what was really going on was 1,000,001 and you thought of all other 1,000,00 ways....
I am not going to humiliate my friend. He almost surely knows that I know he lied to me but I won't bring it up to him. I'm going to let him out gracefully and let him contemplate that and hopefully...
so how would an infj feel if they suddenly realized that the person they lied to had found out about the lie(s)?  defensive and/or angry, or would they feel badly in any way?
I've been seeing my INFJ for just about three and a half months. I'd say I'm well on my way to falling in love with him. We've been seeing each other once a week for the last three months and talk...

It doesn't sound to me like you invaded her personal space so much.  If she got back together with this guy, the feelings were already there for him and anticipating getting back together with him...
the sad part about that is that it might be that the woman/girl you're feeling this way about, could be thinking exactly the same thing about you.  this morning my infj sent me an email saying we're...
Mine definitely can--very silly:)
Early on, neither of you knows how you feel.  The idea of it is to spend some time together and figure out how you feel.  You aren't leading anyone on unless you tell them you feel great about them...
It does sound confusing--we need more info.
Think of it as giving a gift to someone, telling them why you feel as you do.  Everyone wants to feel special and appreciated.  If I think about my INFJ friend and why I feel for him as I do I can...
Oh, heck yes.  If I learned that the guy I was seeing, or a guy who professed to have interest in me, had slept with someone else, I'd drop the relationship like a hot potato.  Either:  a)  he's...

Don't treat it like it never happened--that's the cliche trying to pop an elephant under the rug.  The same thing happened with my INFJ--we slept together way too quickly, and now we stepped back...
My gut reaction is to say yes, do that. But, a little more context--how old are you guys?  Does she have her own place or where is she staying?  Would you like to stay with her?  Since the physical...

This thread is just amusing!! Constantly being added to and updated. :D makes me happy to know others hear things so im not the only odd ducky ^.^
I am currently dating an INTJ and have dated some in the past.Not intentionally! I am just drawn to them. I like how they stand out. :)
Wasn't saying it was bad :P Just stating it can be beneficial.Actually all the INFP's I know and are aware of don't curse period!Is odd.Because to me a word is a word.Just matters the context.They...
It's been tested and found sometimes the people who swear most often are the most trustworthy!Also swearing has been shown to relieve stress and anxiety.
So, I am a newer person to this site.Obviously still trying to understand a lot!But what is with the talk of a sick or immature ENFP's? Have any of you ever been 'sick' or dealt with other ENFP's who...

Perhaps.

Perhaps she just isn't ready.You mentioned she was scared?Also some ENFP's are afraid of perfection or what seems to be good for us.So stick around and try and bear with her.She is probably aware of...
What happened? Is she ignoring you?
Well thank you greatly for your replies! They are valued :) It is kind of rude in my opinion for him to cut me off. Especially after months of not talking. The problem became when he spoke to me out...
TaylorP do you think maybe he couldn't handle it since a few days later he said he couldn't talk to me again?
I'm curious.I followed the advice given.and moved on.But he reached out to me, and said me he missed me..
Could not have put it better myself!
Yes small dogs.I am terrified of them.Don't know why.
I fear heights, getting drunk, being bipolar, people hurting me.And small dogs o.0 :unsure:
That sounds correct actually.Seeing as he requested similar action.He asked I delete him from social media and such.But gave me a number to call one day if I am single and still want to be friends or...
He's the exact same.Very strict in his moral code.Which I respect.Also you are correct it is hard to see all possibility end.
But if it was me single, and he had a gf. No matter how much pain it caused I would still be there for him! I suppose that is what bothers me most.
So I am sure I'm not the first to have this problem but I need help understanding it.Supposedly ENFP's and INTJ's make really great pairs.Well when I first met a particular one he seemed to have...
Thanks!!
Thank you for sharing, I understand more now.
Maybe it's just my emotional attachment.But I find it hard to believe a person who says they love someone would drop them.Over a few words!But I suppose you could be correct.
Snapple then why would he give me his contact info and say when I am single talk to him again?Also thank you for replying.

Well, by flirting I meant that they were touchy-feely. He'd hug her a lot, do cute things like give her piggyback rides, etc., which I know is his way of flirting; but to her, that might just be...

(Deleted). Decided this would be better on another thread as a post - but am unable to delete this thread!
Hello everyone! Do you guys feel like you engage in any sort of emotionally suppressive or avoidant behavior, and if so, could you please describe it? I'm talking about a long term coping mechanism,...
Depends on the insect/pest. Spiders I normally squish. If it's an especially large one or if it's something especially scary, I try to get someone else who's home to get rid of it for me. I do feel...
Yup! I start to think about everything that could happen if I accepted and reacted to the romantic advancements. Like, oh man what if I flirt back, and he asks me out, and we start dating, but I'm...
It seems pretty variant. I think certain personality types are quite prone to high self esteem whereas others are more vulnerable to the opposite (like ENFPs), but not exceptionally so...
Wouldn't want it any other way :wink:    I'm the same way. People say, just be yourself! and I'm like, who's that?   I thought that there'd be more responses given the number of ENFPs I...
Hey squad.  How would you rate your level of confidence/self-esteem, and why?  I know a lot of ENFPs (myself included) who just aren't that confident. Figured I'd get more answers on here!
I have generalized anxiety disorder coupled with episodes of depression (these episodes only last for a few days, though, and seem to come and go randomly). When my anxiety gets really bad, I get...
I know how you feel. I think that there's a big difference, however, between telling people your secrets and allowing people to get close to you. You can be emotionally open, honest and close with...
So, from my own experience as an ENFP - we tend to be a little... non-committal. I don't mean that in the sense that we don't like to get into relationships (quite the contrary, I've found), it's...
Perhaps I'm not coming across clearly - what I was saying was that I am not walking away, because I don't feel able to do that.  I am trying to understand the causes of my ENTJs behavior so that I...
Well, I am trying to make changes - and I seek to understand his behavior and way of thinking so that I'm aware of what needs to be done differently. So no, I'm not just doing the same things and...
Yup. If I'm not mistaken - you've got something going on with an ENFP? I feel like someone in one of the ENTJ forums did.   We're okay, I guess. As per the suggestion of pretty much everyone I...
As ENTJs, do you guys feel like you have a habit of giving people advice, or teaching them - often of your own accord?   I'm friends with an ENTJ who constantly advises me to do things that I'm...
That is quite a good summary, I think - we assume things will get better. And, in our defense, they often do!  I'm surprised at the response rate, and really pleased with the number of ENFPs who...
I have a tendency to stick it out even when a relationship is clearly falling apart or a person isn't interested, or when a friend doesn't treat me well, etc. Is this an ENFP trait? Do you guys...
ENFPs generally prefer to keep the peace rather than become confrontational or stir the pot. Your ENFP friend is probably still feeling hurt but finds it easier to remain friendly with your ex-friend...
Welllll, as an ENFP (and just kind of a neurotic person in general - oops) who is close with an ENTJ, I can come up with some examples. Not that I embody them, or anything.  Crazy to an ENTJ...
My mother is an ISFJ (tested), and she has a really bad tendency to put things off. I was wondering if this is a normal or typical feature of this personality type.    She does this with almost...
That's interesting, I would say that for ENFPs it is the exact opposite (well, for me, anyways). My logical thoughts are buried deep down beneath my feelings. I have to go on a deep sea expedition...
Thank you for the insight. ENTJs are an endless source of frustration for me (not because of who they are, but because of who I am). I feel like I can read people very easily, but I struggle with...
I like that metaphor. What is it about discussing feelings whilst feeling them that makes it so hard? I can discuss my feelings as I'm experiencing them, but what comes out of my mouth won't be very...
Reluctant to share what's going on your life, unwilling to discuss negative emotions or situations, slow to open up. Basically not very willing to discuss personal things.
A question for all ENTJs (or friends of ENTJs, whatevs): Would you consider yourself - or other ENTJs you know - to be closed off? Is that a common trait?
I normally don't say this, but it's really not you... it's him. We've all dealt with people that talk too much for our liking, and that's just it; we deal with them. We put up with their behavior...
Hey, I think you meant to tag me here :)  I took some 5-HTP, which is supposedly a building block of serotonin, although there are some disputes as to whether or not it's really effective. I also...
I think I know what you are going through. In high school, I developed depersonalization (or derealization, they are very similar and I am not sure exactly how they differ), following a period of...
Thank you all for your responses! I've come to realize that my situation can go one of two ways; either we get back together someday, or we don't. I might as well maintain my sanity- what little of...
Hi everyone... this ENFP is back. I know, we're all thrilled. Especially me. If you're confused, I wrote on this thread (it starts on page 63) which led to a lengthy - and very insightful -...
I don't think that you have ADHD, but I also don't think that's worth trying to label yourself because a) what people in school consider to be ADHD is not necessarily what mental health professionals...
I actually believe there are a lot of ENFP cult leaders... they don't call us the inspirers for nothing.  That being said, the ENFP cult would be made up of a bunch of people with fantastic ideas...
I've heard other ENTJs use a storage room or closet metaphor before - all very similar to yours.   And you're quite welcome, do let me know if you'd like some more perspective on your situation...
From personal experience, I can say that yes, I would - if I didn't believe that there was nothing left to read. I mean, nobody ever says move along, there's nothing to see here! when there's...
Sorry that it's taken me so long to reply!  This is by no means easy to do, but when I am feeling down I force myself to act as ENFP-ish as possible. I think that this helps because if you don't...
I don't know if this will help, but speaking as an ENFP, we get really, really frustrated when we can't gauge how someone is feeling. ENFPs like to ~*feel*~ things/people/situations out. When we...
I'm sorry to hear that. It's tough when someone not only doesn't understand you, but blames you for it.
I definitely have periods of negativity. There is a great thread on here about the stages of depression in ENFPs; obviously not every bout of negativity indicates that someone is slipping into...
Dear ENTJs,  OPEN  UP  PLEASE.  It's metaphorically freezing out here!
Yes, absolutely. The examples that I gave, now that I think about it, are basically signs of disrespect. What it comes down to, for me, is autonomy - my ability to exist separately from others, and...
Going behind my back to do something that I specifically asked you not to do, or constantly invalidating my feelings/experiences.  Lying is also a big no-no. I can forgive, but not forget.
Extroversion/introversion refers more to the way that socialization makes the person in question feel, rather than whether or not they do it. An introvert may wish to become more popular by going out...
Hey! Someone posted this in the ENTJ Relationship Questions thread - it's more popular and bound to get you more advice. You should check it out. I'm having relationship trouble with an ENTJ myself,...
Yes, I do! I don't mean to do it and I certainly don't want to do it. I recently realized that when people are angry or upset with me, I automatically react in a way that I know will make them less...'"

I went on one date with an ENFP and I must confess I was a little repulsed by the idea. It was like I got EXACTLY where everything he did to try to charm me came from. He was using MY tricks lol. I...
Just being friendly. Actually when I have a crush for someone I become really shy around them. Go figure :)
I've read it in the past, but really appreciate you reminding me of it. It's time I read it again! :) Thanks!
Thanks RandomBot. It felt good to see you got me.   I also go through dark times that can take a year or two. It's so weird indeed, we have this whole other positive side that sometimes just...
I haven't read other posts but I need to vent and this seems like the right thread. I am feeling utterly lost although I just got my best paying job so far. My immediate family (as in older parents,...
Sure - totally understand and agree haha :) I will keep an eye of course. But now that I joined the same company they work with I realize everyone is just amazingly busy... no time to really be...
So you guys were right... we should take our intuition with a grain of salt. The two people I kind of pre-judged last week by email before meeting them were actually super great people and apparently...
You do need math to build something. But we mostly work in conjunction with Engineers, who study Structures for 5 years. In my country i.e. I am entitled to sign off on the Structural Engineering...
I understand exactly all the things you are talking about (they are very real to me as well!). Good advice.  But I have one question: the trusted advice from a non-intuitive... do you really trust...
Well yes, so here's the problem: because my intuition is so strong (and often right), I form pre-judgement about people and things... and then is becomes like a self-fulfilling prophecy... I often go...
Honestly I still have trouble understanding the below. Fe is a mystery to me.  I do connect easily with everyone, I express warmth often and I self-disclose a lot (yes, mostly so people see I feel...
Uh... not all ENFPs are against politics. I see it as a way to change the world and love it, actually I regret not studying it. I am also ambitious and I understand there's a game to be played and...
From own experience: DO NOT study Architecture. It looks like you can dream and so on... but the reality is that most likely you will be in a desk drawing building details 10 hours per day, at least...
I only had one short fling with an INFJ - probably the only INFJ male I ever met. In the beginning he was super into me, talking about the future and whatnot. We connected very well. Usually I go for...
Confession time...  Often times people do or say things that hit directly my intuition... and I get paranoid and overthink things.  I.e. I am starting a new job and I didn't like a couple of...
I always been terrible at math, but I think it's also because the way teachers teach it, make it really boring. I can't relate to anything that doesn't seem useful in real life. I wish they applied...
Thanks guys, I appreciate the responses. No - I am not changing my personality, that's against ENFP values to not be authentic.   BUT I do feel I can control a little better my emotions and...
I thought I wouldn't go there anymore... INTJs are my kryptonite. I am fascinated by them but it seems I get to the infamous ENFP/INTJ Death Spiral.  But here I am again. Have a date end of next...
He just wrote me so I've calmed down on feeling like a silly s***. Even if it ends up going nowhere, I can tell he enjoyed the connection as well and it was not my crazy mind making it up ;) Wow, and...
I agree. But my question is not really about Judgement... more about how ENTPs connect with that kind of thing (sleeping together, etc, specially if too early). Is it more on an emotional level? Do...
ENTP relationship question part 2: would it turn off a 40ish yo ENTP male if the connection on a first date was so good that it ended up in bed? If ENTPs are nearly open minded as ENFPs, I don't see...
Hi guys. ENFP here. Whenever I meet an ENTP, I kind of fall for them in one hour (lol!) but it never ends up working out. It seems like an amazing match mentally, but there is something about this...
I've been there too... But you can't let one person make you lose your hope in humanity, in love, in idealism.  Most of us go through several heart breaks in life but in the end the truth is they...
Because when you do find someone who is right for you it will not end and you'd know it was all worth it.
I've had times when I was feeling apathy to love and the world in general... and yes it was after being hurt.  I'd seek therapy to work the hurt out. After all, as you said yourself, you want to...
I feel the same with this guy I'm dating. He seemed so open in the beginning and now is kind of closing himself to me although we have great chemistry :rolleyes:
when even though you know your passion/stubborness for things is f-ing you at work... you still can't change and have it differently in a way that it will affect your morals and values.
tlm, I am the same... I hate questioning things to potential partners for the fear of smothering them... I hate making people feel uncomfortable. And I feel stupid being this way. Thanks for sharing,...
THANK YOU InTheRockies! This made total sense. The way you talk reminds me of him ;) And thanks in the name of all of us ENFPs ;) I am finding out I find the same about INFJs - beautiful souls <3 ...
For 4 weeks (since we first met online) he's been in touch several times a day. After we met, about 20 days ago, he kept being in touch all the time, and we had a few dates. After last weeks' date,...
So the pulling away is common with INFJs? And it's specifically about recharging?
Haaa... but... why, _Observer_? Why do you guys do it? What are the real reasons?  And, what's the best way to deal with it? Not initiate texting etc when he's pulling away, and just let him be and...
I'm ENFP and dating an INFJ for the first time. Oh my. I feel it can be a wonderful match.  He was always asking me if I liked him when I wasn't sure. This week I started to become more into him. He...
At the 3 month mark I started to feel weird that the relationship didn't evolve as in my past relationships (most likely with feelers). He wouldn't talk about the future (surprisingly he did when...
The weird thing is he really tries to be super social. I'd say he's more social than me! Maybe it's a I am not THAT nerd mechanism for him, I don't know. I do feel over-analyzed and let me tell...
Not really... if what you're asking is if he said he loved me or so. He did say personal things in the past but he also said he's not that comfortable sharing certain things. Oh well.
Yay so happy an INTJ is answering thanks bluekitdon!   I was a little emotional about where we stood in the 3 month mark. When I saw he didn't respond well, I just swiped it under the rug.  I did...
Thanks chimeric. He would plan 3 dates a week on the first three months and be in touch a lot.  The last month things changed, he was away 3 straight weekends and working a lot during the week...
I've been dating this INTJ guy for 4 months. We're around 40s.  I like him a lot, but I can't help but feel like I'm at an emotional desert.  It's so frustrating. I am feeling lonely and not...
Thank you MindBomb, it was great to read your story and try to grasp the way an apparently mature INTJ thinks.  ps: love Keane and that album you have as your avatar ;)
LOL. You and I apparently live in different planets mentally-wise. I really, really don't identify with anything you say or your accusations, and couldn't care less about your (false) observations...
ps: Oh just noticed your nickname is Countryboy. We are both City people, metropolis people. I should be Citygirl! So no offense but I understand where your ideas might be coming from.
1) Darling - who said we were trying to avoid it? I was in a relationship a year ago and as I said I don't want to discuss it but we almost had a child. Does that make me not entitled to be in...
Thank you so much Countryboy really liked the first part of your answer, extremely helpful.  The second part I might have written incorrectly, as I decided NOT to bring it to term. I hope you are...
It did. Thank you andy. I guess that's what my question is about really. If rational plans can be changed due to changed feelings about someone/something.
Yes indeed.... wth.
We actually been talking about it since week 1... it's a sensitive topic between us, and I thought by now he would not stick around due to this issue but he is still here... I actually got pregnant...
How can you possible relate to my entitlement if you're not a woman? The day you turn to be a woman, we can talk about it.
I don't agree with you. Say what? as long as there's younger females being born, meeting enough of them  will mean he'll eventually find one that likes him as much as she does.   I'm sorry for...'"

Apparently my sarcasm wasn't noted... And where would you get the assumption that I hate myself and need approval from others? Weren't you JUST ranting about assumptions?!!! tisk, tisk. Sweet dreams!...

Shucks, I thought offering you virtual pie would for SURE change your mind. Haha I'm just a playful person and actually... I can't see myself with another ENFP.   BONUS: I can cook! Does that win...

It takes a lot of growing and maturing for anyone- regardless of type- to share their emotions. And as I said before, I am not sure of his emotional health; I never claimed to be.   I am very sorry...
Aw thanks :kitteh: *takes a dramatic bow*     Oh yes! I was wondering why you seemed to understand me so well and then I looked over and saw you were an ISTP. Makes sense now.
Feel free!    I had never heard of anyone doing that before so much ESFJ insight. I guess it is so different from the way I am. Why change myself?! I am a procrastinator, always late, talk too...
It depends on the situation...  If I lose someone close to me due to death, I listen to sad music, cry by myself, talk to an INFJ friend about it just to let it out...total introvert mode. When...

Don't give up! Sometimes we go through trials  and run into crazies; this help us grow emotionally and mature socially. All of that prepares us for the right person.

Thank you for all of your responses.  You definitely gave me some insight into gullibility. For instance, I hadn't connected it to a lack of experience or naivety.  Gullible is something that I was...
The more connected and purposeful I feel in my life, the more magical life feels.  For instance, helping my children who are like the child I once was feels like time travel.  And saying thank you...
Hello infps, Are you gullible?  I have been called gullible, and I'm wondering if it is because I have such a wild imagination that I can always find a way for things to be possible.  Any other infps...
I just created a FB page to use for my massage business.  I'm just getting started, so it isn't very well defined, and that is part of what I am using the page for is playing with ideas.    'Like'...
34 is my age number right now.
Thanks, Belovodia!  Are you an E2 by chance?  I tend to think E2 for Needy Child.  I haven't studied his orgone therapy at all.  Or anything beyond some introduction to his armouring theory/character...'"


2377: First of all, what she feels is totally normal. I'm uncertain if this feeling is ENFP-based, or if it can be found across the board, but what I know for certain is that it is something that at least...
It takes a surprising amount to move me, usually art will do it. Art has always seemed in some ways more real to me than reality, or maybe I just let it affect me more. But yeah... I cried to at that...
For me this question is complicated.  On the one hand I tend to be and really always have tended to be obsessively humble, to the point where it bugs me a little to even say that I'm humble....
This is ridiculously true for me too! I hardly pay any attention to such things, it's just not something I care about, it's soooo routine, but it is so important too.
Yeah I'd say just leave things alone until she's available. You don't wanna have any part of that, even if she were to fall desperately in love with you and leave her boyfriend, you've made an enemy...
I think it's fantastic that you're seeing someone to help you sort out your feelings instead of not giving them credence. Your feelings are important, just as important and useful as your intellect,...
Easy, My mom is an ENFP, just like me. Funny though because I don't always get along with her, however we speak the same language, she's disorganized, she VERY feelings oriented and she's definitely...
Yeah... that's exactly how my last relationship went. In a month's time we could anticipate each other better than i could anticipate my best friend for 10 years. We had catchphrases and knew exactly...
Well hold on now ethereal this forum is about people comparing their experiences to one another, not necessarily about getting over our problems. Most of the people posting here are just stating how...
Nobody's too old for that, it'll be a sad day the day i find i can't tell the world just to shut up and leave me alone.
Oki oki mr. ISTP, u win:tongue: Everyone loves music and its determined by the individual! Your logic impeccably trounced me:wink:
Ok fair point, but I figure if anyone's gonna be really outspoken about their ALL ENCOMPASSING LOVE for music, it would prolly be the ENFPs, though I'm sure everyone does have a love of music.......
Pie is definately good, the cake is always a lie anyway. Welcome kindred spirit!
...Play on! That's insane that you have 70GB, I thought I had a huge library, but I'm not even halfway to your level lol.
I love to write, and I've always been talented at it (what am I not talented at though? maybe modesty) however, I'm so easily distracted it makes it difficult for me to finish anything. Ironically...
I've known another ENFP who intimidated me by being so many things that I wanted to be. It really challenged me to push to be my true self as much as possible.  :shocked: I have a short post?...
Every ENFP I've ever met has had a deeply intense connection with music, including myself. And this means music in any variety. I mean really deeply intense. Rap counts as much as Broadway or...
Yeah.... it was pretty much between Jasmine and Belle........ AGH the choices!!! Eventually, zexiness won out, sadly enough. I dunno, I shoulda prolly picked belle..... WHY do I stress about these...
I totally know how you feel even as an ENFP, because even people savy people still have doubts in themselves, and that's all your problem amounts to.  First off, you know what people love? To talk...
The most mind-blowingly awesome for ENFP job I've ever had was on a commercial as a production assistant. I'm currently doing everything I can to get into the film industry partly as a result. It was...
Wow... I just read yer monster post there at the top of the page.......... and like lilsnowy, I'm really glad you decided to share so much of yourself with us. Honestly, my situation is even more...
Ok, I haven't read all the other posts in between the first and this one, but Pink, I think I can give some really good insight. I'm in a very similar situation, except I'm the guy.  Also, I love...
Am I the only one here who feels awkward when it comes to feelings... like sometimes I think they should be there and they're not? Or that they're much less intense than they should be? Perhaps its...
I accepted the inevitable truth that, well, I'm smarter than pretty much anyone else, it just doesn't show up in my grades. Doesn't have a thing to do with the fact I'm a super genius. It's...
Really? Really really? In your dreams your spiders help you? I soooooo ENVY you! Just to let you know, if some ninja-like guy shows up at your house in the middle of the night to steal your dreams...
Yeah, I think more than anything though, ENFPs come across as gullible to others because we are eager and in the moment and we generally seem innocent. However, older wiser ENFPs tend to use this as...
Sometimes having a slacker for a study partner is nice. As long as they show up and you're not like collaborating on a project or something, its always nice to have someone worse than you, at least...
I have terrible long-term memory. Short term memory is great for me though, even within a week or two's time. I don't take notes in class because I get the general gist of it all and I can just...
Te for me has become the way I attempt to make decisions, even though my natural form is to feel out the best result. This creates a sort of hybrid approach to my decision making, but also undermines...
I feel more like Moby, except that I've come to realize that it's not that I don't dream, it's that I don't remember my dreams. I think it has something to do with how we ENFPs are soo here and now...
I know it's kindly meant, but I've never seen leaping into someone else's arms do more than cause problems and destroy relationships. I think the second part of your response is far wiser. There's...
It sounds more serious than it did at first, and it may very well be time to break it off. All I would urge you to do is first try really being honest with him about where you are at, and find out if...
And yeah, sometimes, we ENFPs do love too much. But that too will pass. Rreally. I really do hope I've said something that makes you feel better. :wink:
Honestly, I don't believe in incompatible people, only unwilling people, which at times might be legitimate. So coming from that I would have to say you two need to figure out how to work together....
Aw man that sucks, I assume it's the one from your other thread. Saying one knows how one feels is kinda pointless with situations like these so I won't even try. I have been in your situation before...
Thanks man for the advice and support for a stranger. And I too hope it all turns out. I figure heck, a year can solve anything right? I mean I'm like 21 so EVERYTHINGS the like MOUNT DOOM END OF THE...
Well, Ivan, we are only five% of the population apparently, which makes us all really happy cuz we like to feel especially unique.  I totally feel you MissyMaroon. And I'm a guy. While I maintain a...
Just so you know, my mom is the ENFP in the family, and even though it makes sense that she's more emotional, it doesn't stop my dad from blaming her for it. ISTJ's can be ones to assign blame, I...
Oh, and btw, I've got an ISTJ dad too... he can be a pain sometimes, but he does love you, he just shows you through dedicated work, instead of superfluous stuff like... being generally nice lol....
Oh my GOSH that's a long post, I can't tell in this format lol... shoulda paired it down a tad...
ENFPs tend to take things personally in general. It's the F in us. So wakehopper I totally feel where you're at right now. I'm in pretty much the same situation, with my younger siblings getting to...
Yeah,Sagittarius here. But there just doesn't seem to be much correlation. Not that I'm surprised, I put virtually no stock in zodiac. Honestly, is it just me or do zodiac descriptions seem rather...
Long time for a post to happen, but here it is. I had to stand up to a best friend of 8 or so years on account of his gf breakin up with him. He wouldn't accept it, and I had to let him know that he...
That sux Shurikun... hey this looks like fun lemme git in on it! So I always feel like I'm never the best version of myself, like if I was REALLY an ENFP or if I was REALLY crazy or if I was REALLY...
Yeah, remember guys, we are ENFPs which means we are are own worst critics, evaluating ourselves and reevaluating ourselves so many times over that we feel totally awkward in situations that we would...
K first thing I want to say, which I can tell by your tone you know, but just to remind, crying for any reason is not a sign of weakness. It's a sign of honesty, its our emotions telling us that we...
I don't have a wealth of relationship experience to pull from, but I have grown up in a home where my mom was ENFP and my dad was ISTJ. Complete opposites, so I know something of differences. The...
Thank you all so much, especially SuperunknownVortex and variableresults for their perspectives as INFJs. I really do care a whole lot about this friend, so much so that I'm willing to do what it...
Yep dude that's totally natural. The type of people we are is the type that cares deeply about people, and focuses very intensely on anyone that we are talking to, ESPECIALLY if they are confiding in...
The iNtuition, definately. We think randomly, without any discernible order, we make assumptions and intuitive guesses that are really right most times. It makes us incredibly creative and..."


2387: 'Let's call it a 6.9 for me. (Mind out of the gutter, folks)

Holism and Realism and Anti-Symbolism... sounds about right for me:    EDIT:  I don't think it does here. With me, it's just about being interested in the possibilities of the world, especially...

On the non-video-game-front, billiards, foosball and Cards Against Humanity jump to mind lately.  As for video games, I played it all as a kid, but these days I prefer something competitive that...
I'm sorry, the question still doesn't make any more sense to me.
N-neither?  What in this scenario limits the final choices down to they stay and they die to me?  I'm a pretty tolerant guy with who I let hang around me.  Not confirming to my values doesn't...
I don't think I can vote on this poll.  My values are centred on the well-being of others in the first place, and I have trouble imagining any scenario where what is best for others would conflict...
That's exactly what you've got to do: put yourself out there.  I met my current INTJ friend through a competitive fighting game tournament, and things naturally picked up from there as we realized...
I just really want to echo what randomshoes mentioned in her post.  The enneagram tests are just not all that strong.  I ran into the same 2 and 4 issue myself back in the day.  Try to read up on all...
Mindfulness and metta meditation have been great for me.  Working them into my life contributed to putting my bipolar disorder into remission (alongside medical support), and general helped me reign...
Ah, ISTP humour; I know thee well.  One of my best friends from the start of high school became a master of this, and I admired it to no end.  I'd occasionally try my hand at initiating this brand of...
It's more of a coincidence that the year's end is coinciding with my health-uncertainties finally settling, letting me focus back on realistic goal-setting, but hey, I'm sure I'll tell someone that...
More dynamic photos might help, but I was thinking about the stuff in the self-summary. You use a lot of direct I'm this and I'm that constructions, when it might benefit more from playful...
If I said less tell and more show, would you understand what I'm getting at?
I definitely teared up in watching Silver Linings Playbook in theatres a year ago.  ***General spoiler in next paragraph***   The movie hit incredibly close to home for me, and felt like reliving...
I found this pair of articles enlightening and true to practice.  See how they strike you:  1/2 Why Procrastinators Procrastinate 2/2 How to Beat Procrastination

Oh wow.  Clearly resurrection is possible if a forum account can rise from the ashes after so many years! :wink:  I find it really funny that you learned two incredibly important lesson from your...
I did as a kid, but corrected it around the age of 12 or 13.  (Thank you slavedriver ESTJ dad. xD)
You know when you're watching a sporting event and they have two announcers?  A play-by-play guy will describe what's actually happening as it happens, and another person will fill dead-air with...
Generally, I'd say I'm more the kind of guy who tries to draw people into talking.  I initiate a lot of conversations if only because I'm endlessly (and arbitrarily) curious about people.  I can't...
It's my primary way of writing/instant messaging some people (mostly people I met travelling), so I keep it around.  A good ENFP friend of mine, however, got fed up with it, turned his into a...
Great idea for a topic, SoM! Let me see what I can figure out.  Introversion:  - (Slightly) More of a listener than a talker - Studied literature (and eternally debating studying Library Science)...
It's kind of hard to pinpoint, but I think I feel deeply unresourceful and wasteful right now.  I've been going on for what feels like forever recovering from a surgery, every week being reassured by...
There there man. :/ Which are you looking for: solid ground in the world or solid ground within yourself?  They're two dramatically different problems.  It was the latter that bothered me.  My...
Is it bad that I pretty much anticipated the entire story as I was reading it?  Maybe it's because I know a few IxTP's in that line of work in a certain Tim Horton's-ladden film-making city that you...
I can relate to where you're coming from.  The household I grew up in was pretty Te-heavy and light on the physical contact and it's definitely trained me to try and talk through a lot of things in...
My mom's an INTJ, and my dad's an ESTJ. It's like Tertiary Fi + Inferior Fi = Auxiliary Fi!
Taste good, apparently make good pets... what's not to like?
I've had a good spread of awesome INTJ friends, and we've never really had a problem finding ways to have a good time. The INTJ lady-friends I've had over the years were great for hitting up in a...
You're definitely not alone.  I struggled a lot with this condition in university, but seem to have a pretty good hold over it now, ~6 years later, to the point of being told that it's well into...
Huh, why not?  I dated an INFJ for almost 4 years while she studied computer science at a top-university and worked off-terms at IBM.  She's mad successful now.  I can tell from experience that the...
Naw, I can't totally relate, Mucha, but I've know a lot of great people who struggled with the same kind of thing.  I'd have probably pegged them all as enneagram 8's though (sometimes Si-users,...
Ah, fair enough.  Knowing myself, I couldn't have written off Walmart's needs any differently than any other company's.  An organization of people is an organization of people regardless, and I'd...
The problem with this approach is that it can be agonizing for those of us who are sensitive to the fact that organizations pour real time and money into the interviewing process.  Going in knowing...
ESFP, to flat-out compare Se-dom and Ne-dom living.
This, definitely this.  I'm always especially coming back to the idea of triumphing over my own nerves when I compete.    However, it's also about improving the people you're competing against, so...
Can you pin down whether you're more comfortable toying with subjective, value-based topics or objective, empirical topics when you're in the company of others/engaging with the outside world?  The...
It's the Ti/Te debating-divide that I always notice.  The ENTP is more prone to arguing to push an objective point that they feel they already settled on, whereas the ENFP will engage in discourse to...
Only one area jumps to mind that annoyed me about my INFJ ex-GF, and it really wasn't a deal-breaker by any means.  My delightfully classy, worldly and sympathetic INFJ had the uncharacteristic...

Ooo. What type of negotiating have you been up to?
I can't really say I've had a problem on any of these fronts.  I've lived in student residences and hostels where the girls outnumbered 7:1, and I'd drag groups of girls out for nights on the town...
Lately, the majority of single-player games I've tried, I've abandoned due to my own nitpicking.  I'm too much of a literature snob to handle the way most single-player games approach narrative, and...
Hmm, the title of the thread and what you're specifically asking don't really agree.  I have absolutely no spirituality of my own, but I have an interest in other people's spiritual sides...
An ENFP doesn't necessarily need to place value on empathy even if they have a knack for perspective-switching, and their value system can really lead them anywhere depending on what was going on...
I'd say I was a pretty passionate student who poured everything I could into all my studies, and had a knack for drawing original connections between divergent topics.  As a result, the projects I...
Heh.  So what do you mean by this?  Do you just have trouble putting your feelings into words and consolidating them in the terms of the outside world?  That's more Fe's domain anyway.  The bigger...

I know exactly what you're talking about. What I think I'm going to do is find a good linearly thinking friend and get them to help me organize my thoughts and options.
As an INFP, I know I OFTEN completely miss that someone likes me. It just goes over my head. To everyone else it's obvious but I guess my heads to far in the clouds to notice. So, I agree with...

I do feel a bit used, or at least I did that night. I'm not sure why but perhaps it was because all night he was very touchy, if not trying to grope my pants just laying on me, etc. It's all very odd...
Oh you aren't being hard on me at all! I appreciate your feedback. I still don't really believe he loves me but that might be me just feeling a but weird about that concept. Just seems way too...
I kind of disagree. I don't doubt that he likes me, but I don't think he loves me. Like I said the minimal contact for three weeks, and he doesn't want to hang out all the time. If he loved me I...
Thank you for this. I did text with him last night, seem like things are much better. I don't love him though--I don't use that word lightly so I definitely wouldn't go as far as to say that. And I...
Um are you guys reading the same thread? How in the world was I playing games and messing with him when I went to his house? I had no idea what to expect. I was not being passive aggressive either. I...
The two months where I cut him off I explained before hand that I was going to stop talking to him and I explained why. I told him that I would reach back out when I was ready to be platonic friends....
That's not true. I didn't think we were fwb anymore. If you remember my threads, a month ago after we had sex and he had alluded to not wanting to do an fwb and gave me reasons I myself tried to make...
I don't want him as a boyfriend. I don't want a boyfriend right now but would eventually like a boyfriend when my plate clears up. But I do what to understand what exactly he is doing. I had...

I did not put him through an emotional roller coaster. And if I did it was not intentional. It had nothing to do with stress in those occasions-I just wasn't certain how to proceed with him, so I...
I am stressed. Like I said there are other unresolved things going on in my life. But I don't like feeling bad. I like to feel happy or at least stable. This situation and others are not making me...
No closure for me is not friendship, or fwb.   I can't be his friend. I tried to be platonic. This was after two months of no contact. I approached him again platonically. He acted as if those two...
He was an intj. I believed so based on many of his behaviors. He participated in small talk with me last week, but more like one liners(I.e. Why did you do that) in response to a story I might have...
I'm trying to move on. Like I said I've posted on the enfp forum to ask for closure on how to let this go. I've never experienced this in my life and it's hard to close it but I'm determined to, I...
He wasn't ever in favor of it. I suggested it, he agreed. Was hesitant for weeks, then after I pressured him, we had sex. Afterwards when I inquired about the FWB status, he said that FWBS never end...
I've posted about my situation on the INTJ thread mainly, because it involved an INTJ. You see I've been in a limbo with this INTJ for about a year now. It started off hot and intense, with us having...

I cannot thank you enough for your help, like I said it looks like he started dating someone else and still wants to be friends. Weird..
Oh I know about all that! :D I'm just hoping we CAN be friends again. How am I selfish? I'm asking so I can avoid that in the future :)
Read this - Socionics - the16types.info - Four Quadra The description of the ENFP seems really really off, exactly opposite of what it should be.

I sent all of that to him and he's like Im glad you said what you needed to say.
Interesting because he was going more for the motivational/making life better thing near the end, maybe that's the route to be friends with him again?

I agree, ENTPs are bored with most people but when they find one person that they really enjoy, they will be with them to no end.  It's like they become cohorts or partners in crime with them

Hehe, nothing in my life is straight! Straight is boooring, one way or the other, hehe :-)

I`m not so good at cuddling, but I`m FABULOUS at serving wine or cocktails and putting  on the perfect music :-))

Hm... Still a newbie on this forum, but am still eternally grateful to pinkraspuntin/The King Of Dreams because of the fantastic feel-good-thread about ENFP-men :)) Will NEVER forget that one :-))  ...
Nice to hear this from an ISTJ. If I meet an ISTJ with this approach I wouldn`t run away instantly, hehe.
Thank you, and YES it does! My primary love language is words of affirmation and quality time (both 12 points). And I LOVE giving speeches and communicate with words to other people :-)
Wooord!! This is EXACTLY me!!
Btw, I tested him again and he`s not an ISTJ, he`s an ESTJ, if that makes things better, LOL!
Yes, indeed, I was able to have loads of fun! I have come to the same conclusion as you. This is not good for me, neither for him, because I kind of feel that it is my need of helping others that...

2841: You know I've never dated and ISTP, may not even know one actually. But I have dated an ISTJ and an ESTP. I'm the opposite of some of you, I tell my boyfriend to listen to the song 'More Than Words'...
Personally I have grown very fond of any and all INTJs, my best friend is one, along with two other male friends... one I am considering dating.  I find their criticism and orderliness very helpful....
Pretending to do some schoolwork, listening to music and thinking it's about time to eat.
GTBean, I can very much agree with everything you said. I would have to say that both of us were very attached at the time and in living together and not being able to be around other people we...
I completely agree with Pilgrim, we women like a guy who can relate and the feeling side of you does that. xD
You know my mother, she is an INFP dear.
Yeah, I dated another ENFP once.. bad BAD idea! Hahaha.
Yeah, yeah we do... haha.
I can agree with that, best of luck to you my friend. I feel the same about my ESTP that I am so obsessed with... but I'm beginning to thing I need to look more for and NTP... He isn't coming back...
Yeah, they do that... my nickname for my twin is 'Egotistical Asshole' when he's upset over something... it's quite a way to wear an ENFP down if you ask me.
I'm sorry you're having to deal with that, I know it's a fairly painful experience... I'm not going through that, but something similarly painful. I've never really understood my INTP friends'...
I completely agree, I had a boyfriend once that liked to say I promise about some of the smallest and simplest things and yet didn't understand why when he broke it I was upset. What it is about...
Welcome my introverted friend. =)
I would have to say that I have been prone to addiction, all it takes is one time and then I'm so hungry to do it again that I keep it up and tend to not consider stopping for several years at a...
I would say that my main thing would be people that don't take time to truly get to know me and understand me, which yes does require trying to see things from my point of view.
I think it's just an ENFP quality really... I've always been that way and from time to time it lands me into some serious trouble. xP
Love it. I'm sixteen ans that's totally me without my Mountain Dew.

Eclectic, extroverted, amusing, creative and intelligent.
I have many siblings but only one still lives in the home, my twin brother who is an INTP, he and I are the youngest.
Welcome, it's nice to have you. =)
Haha, welcome, always nice to see a fellow ENFP. =)
No, he moves from friend's house to friend's house, now that his car has broken down anyways. He did live with me and when I moved he could no longer live with me and moved into his car.
You are correct in assuming he is a bit of a loner, he is never in one place for very long, claiming he is off and about adventuring to... 'find himself' and until then he is naught but his own.

Moby I can actually agree with you. ENFPs seem like we could be great friends/friends with benifits but not much more than that.
Oh I often write stories for my mother's newspaper but then I write a lot of poetry and I dabble in other fictional things... Currently, I am writing a book.
I rarely have a male in tow unless perhaps it is an old friend, a brother and a brother's friend. Or of course an actual boyfriend, I'm not much for extras hanging about.
Somehow I see my path as quite similar. xP
It took a lot of time before it became a release for me... that and a lot of extrmemly long journal entries ranting and raving.  Yes, I am a writer... it is all I can think to do. =)

I'm a writer, or at least I say that I am. But I have grown up with a mother who is in the newspaper buisness. I like writing poetry but my best poetry comes when I am not attempting to think of...

Very needy, in fact ridiculously so... I finally slapped him and told him to back up and grow some balls... which isn't like me to do.. not really. ;P  Haha, nice, yeah when I told my ex-ENFP...
Okay, so I'm not much for movies but I've got to agree with some of these...  Doc Holiday from Tombstone, he's just epic, I watched that years ago and STILL quote it.  Clint Eastwood is almost...
Yeah my name is awful in my opinion. Virginia, but I go by Gin, and Raine is my middle name. =)
*cough* ..... *cough* Okay yeah I can't do it either. -.- But yours is nice. xP
Welcome! =) Always nice to see another ENFJ, I have a couple of you as friends. =)
Well, I hang around several types but the majority are INTP or INTJs, there's an ENTJ an ESTP..
Welcome, it's great to see another ENFP. =)
I agree very much. It would also explain why I tend to spend more time with INTPs and INTJs than other personality types."

A really fucked up ENFP might be pretty scarey, Fi gone terribly wrong has the potential for some screwed up behavior. But in terms of overall damage INFJs take the prize for villains.

You don't believe that unwitting guinea pigs has a bit of a negative connotation?

When I was little, my role models were my dad and Anne from Anne of Green Gables (even though she's fictional). Now that I'm in my teens, my role model is Candice Accola (who i believe is an ENFJ).
reckless summer nights 8w7 I'm guessing, but I'm new at enneagram.
reckless summer nights Yeah, I meant ISFJ! Sorry!
Thanks for the feedback, guys! organicstalker maybe I'm just not getting along well with her because I'm a teenager. :kitteh:
I'm INFP and I'm attracted to ENFJ, other INFP's and INFJ. Of course, I don't limit myself to just those, but those are the kind I'm attracted to most often.
My mom is an ISFJ, my dad is an ISTJ. I don't get along perfectly with either of them (half the reason being I'm a teenager and the other half being religious differences). However, I do get along...
I have between a 3 and 4 with my dad. Much better than my relationship with my mom.

Eric-ISTJ Donna-INFP Fez-ENFP Hyde-INFP Jackie-ENFP Kelso-ESFP Red-ISTJ Kitty-ENFJ
Ted-ESTJ Robin-ENTJ Lily- I think ENFP, but I'm iffy on her, maybe ESFP Marshall-ESFJ Barney-ENTP

Yes. I think it may be important to point out here, that ENFPs and INTJs are not so dissimilar in our emotional makeup.  We both share Fi.  The same ramblings and inner workings exist with ENFPs, we...

Yeah, specifics are a huge pain. I actually enjoyed math up untill I got to Pre-Calc. It somewhow always opened up more possibilities as I understood more math that let my creativity flow even more...
and when you consider browsing these forums as much more productive because you are learning a lot and getting amazingly creative ideas from them.
never ever to get sick.  If everything goes as planned ...
Definetely not! :)  I can get distracted by almost anything, and specifics.. well they just don't work very well with us do they :)
That is the most common thing that I do. A lot of the time I talk as if someone is listening and does not understand what my thoughts mean, as if the imaginary person could read my thoughts and is...
People try to take away everything that they think is a distraction so that you can focus on something specific and actually get it done. Even after all of the work they do you still seem to get...

I've always assumed my sister was an ESFJ because she's clearly an Fe-dom, she's an extrovert, and is very particular about things being done the way they're supposed to be done. So I thought yep,...
Yes I have a love-hate relationship with nostalgia. I look back at the good times for short periods and it's so lovely; I'm like oh yes! These experiences added to my collection of mental stories...
I always make sure to read carefully; I'm a lawyer so it's kind of my thang. I think we're going to have to agree to disagree on what specificity means.  Based off your line that you don't like to...

Definitely Elizabeth Bennett played by Keira Knightley (an ENFP).  People argue Lizzy is an INFJ in the books and my INFJ friend claims the BBC version, but Keira Knightley definitely re-creates her...
certainly! All my ancestors are English or Scottish (with the odd great-grandmother being German) so I was kind of keen to see my ancestral homeland. Also England has the unique edge of being the...
Ok this is an interesting side note. There is a guy my friends have been thinking about setting me up with who I have creeped on Facebook a little bit (heehee) and his little bio says he's an ISTJ,...
how come! I loved it. All 10 hours from Exeter to Edinburgh :laughing: it was in March, the sun was shining and the land was beautiful, lambs were being born and running around the fields in southern...
I would second Stonehenge being really underwhelming, but I was very fortunate to meet a man there who was working on an exhibit for a museum where he was going to famous locations, and drawing the...
Yeah strong Fi is a nostalgia explosion. I get that too with songs I grew up with or certain images.

OMG. No love for Snape yet?!  My #1 INTJ fictional love is John Preston from Equilibrium <3 <3 <3 Jurgen from Equilibrium is also dreamy. That whole movie is basically a love letter to INTJs....

I responded to this a week ago but then my computer crashed and I couldn't bring myself to rewrite anything right away :bored:   So I just read this article:...

Ahhh that Amy video was so cringeworthy.  Yeah I would agree with this. ENFJs are not usually so petty. I dated an ENFJ and he was super particular about his own apartment, but would never do...
I think the rules make sense logically... like with the perceiving pairs and judging pairs. You are always going to have one introverted and one extraverted and to have otherwise would arrive at...
Very interesting theory HeadofHudet! I definitely have my doubts about which functions are developed first. I don't think it necessarily is in stack order. As I have mentioned in a post in the ENTJ...

LOVE puns!! I got into rapping recently because suddenly something that people consider cringeworthy becomes cool!!
It's tough but I have always felt like an ENFP's calling and vocation are not meant to be the same thing. Initially I did because I wanted to be a doctor, but I got into medicine classes and hated...
It's not healthy criticism at all, so you need to stop trying. I think of my little brother who was told by one of his friends that he was being cocky, who he then totally blew up at. At the same...
This tells two different stories. It may be that he will only tell you what's actually wrong when he's in a tirade. Their Fi is so small and fragile that they go big and loud when they're feeling...
That's so unfortunate. I have only had good experiences with ENTJs. They have tempers and like to blow up when they think you're wrong because they get all worked up on the issue and how wrong they...
Yeah that would be a no vote for me. Although it wouldn't be the worst match. I grew up with a father who I did not get along well with who was/is CONVINCED he is an ISTJ, and that really turned me...

I guess I'll pay more attention to my introverted friends' moods before trying to socialize?
Really? That's actually pretty interesting. :D
For what? You didn't do anything. :D
I think it depends on the ENFP and the INFJ. Maybe a less extroverted ENFP, or a more Extroverted INFJ would have more success in a relationship with each other. Or more or less Judging/Perceiving....

ISFPs and ESFJs. ISFPs have Ni as their third function, while ESFJs have it as their third, so there could be quite a bit of confusion!

Just move to New Hampshire, U.S. then, I won't be too far.
You work for a tire company, by chance?  Edit:nevermind...just saw the beer and smokes comment.
Post it in both. Fuggit.
lol....I didn't mean I just moved here. I've been in New Hampshire foralmost 15 years. I grew up in Connecticut.I still go down to visit family all the time. you are right that we have not had very...
I moved from CT, where its more mild for New England Weather, to NH......How bright I?
Didn't realize you were a fellow New Englander.

3635: This is a concept I have been trying to communicate/get across to my husband for at least the last ten years, so I will be curious to see what others have experienced. My husband is an ISTJ....and...
Never say 'never'. Your statement is absolutely untrue.
Welcome!! And I am glad I am not the only one that finds the smiley to be creepy :-)
Welcome! One of my good friends is an ENTP and he teaches a few adjunct courses at a local university...though he admits he wouldn't want to do it full time, he does enjoy it as it adds variety to...
Welcome! Love you ISTJs with your stability and loyalty...things that I crave but hate at the same time :-)
I love to party!! Even in my 30s! But...I don't want to do it all the time. I need low key moments and downtime, too.
DUH!! You either stand and hover over your computer until kitty leaves on his/her own, or you pick said kitty up and CUDDLE and KISS her/him until they are annoyed with you :)
One of my best friends, and one of the people I care most about in this world is an INTP...I am an ENFP and I am sure I must drive her crazy sometimes. We seem to have a great balance, though, even...
BTW - I really love your avatar - where can I get me one of those? I have one around here somewhere...but can't find it anymore.
Welcome, fellow ENFP :-)
I am completely drawn to ISTJs, you guys amaze me. As an ENFP, I admire your stability and capacity to love others through taking care of their practical needs (not sure if this is typical, but that...
Oh...and I am an ENFP and I really could use a hug right now...and for someone to let me cry for a bit.  And I don't think I could exactly articulate why...
I am an ENFP and, I hate to admit it, but it hurts me to my core when I realize someone does not love me as much as I love them. Or when I find out I put others off - that really sucks.
YES!!! Except I call them cows. :-) My masters thesis is in this topic area...
I LOVE public speaking if: 1. I know the topic area inside and out 2. I can joke with the audience (in other words, I have to know the audience...not the individuals, though) 3. I am on center...
I had a a good friend drop me over a year ago. I knew what she was doing because I had seen her do it to others. She doesn't typically make it permanent, but it hurt me so much that I became stubborn...
Spree or kick...call it what you want, but I know EXACTLY what you mean :-)
Of course!
Yep. I am still processing my response to you LOL
Ugh. Sometimes I am sick of always being the person that tries to understand where everyone else is coming from...what don't you try to understand me for once? Care enough to do that. Thank you.
AND you can't articulate how it made you feel!!!
I get it...I really do...but can't quite articulate how I feel about it yet :-)
I'm so sorry for you...I know the feeling and am halfway there myself. For me, it seems to occur when I feel I've done something to damage a relationship or when I have had little contact with people...
Also my favorite in the franchise! I never cared for the original much...and I hope I can say I am also too young to have fully appreciated it...it was off the air when I was a kid, so I think I can...
Thanks for the guide!
Welcome, fellow ENFP :-)
Welcome! ENFP here...and also new :-)
Welcome!
Welcome! I am an ENFP that is married to an ISTJ...makes for a very interesting relationship :-) Enjoy the site!
Welcome! Always wanted to visit Miami!
Welcome! I hope you are able to find other freedoms in your new normal. Good luck :-)
Welcome! Is your username a TNG reference?
Welcome!
Whatever I feel like doing...don't stifle me! Lol Definitely spit mouthwash, though...and swallow whiskey and tequila, but not at the same time. Hey...do you think pointy shoes are completely out of...
Definitely not alone! I always have my journal with me (for figuring out my feelings and some creative writing) just in case no one is in the mood to talk. I wonder how many ENFPs engage in this type...
Welcome! I am new here, also, and share your sentiments about this site. I am an ENFP, though, but believe it or not, I often feel a little lonely even when I am with others.

I generally want to laugh or be entertained...Shows I love and have loved...* next to all time favorites The Chappelle Show The office* Parks and rec * Whose line is it anyway (this show cracked...
I really feel for you because I truly understand how you are feeling. I am in a similar situation...only have my thesis left, but haven't been able to even start it...can't decide what to do for it...
I often want to run away and start a new life...there is just so much I haven't yet done or seen or been part of...and I also think of morbid things, then beat myself up for thinking them :-)
I'm an ENFP and I can't decide what to say... :happy:

To be honest, I don't think so but that comes from my own Ne not working that way.  It seems too fantastical for even an Ne Dom to believe without a very, very firm belief in this feels right. ...
I'm curious as to your reasoning, sir.  I know I see a hell of a lot of Fi on Tumblr.  Ne/Se in the shared pictures, but so much damn Fi on the actual pages.  I'm looking at you, otherkin.
And these charts also fail to account for gender differences in romantic preferences and compatibility.  My self and other ENFP males generally don't like ISTJ women, as we typically don't want women...
Agreed, and this list is awful.  It puts ENFP as having a conflict-prone relationship with INFP, while ISTJ is an ideal match.  Only in Hollywood movies is this true.  In real life, my INFP...
ENTJs?  I wouldn't figure a lot of ENTJs would care for that.  Also, INFP and ISFP both seem far more common on the Tumblr sphere, given self-identification on the pages I've seen.  It's actually not...

Genie from Alladin is probably the most obvious example. Naruto Uzumaki and Monkey D. Luffy are in the shonen genre corner. Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Simba from The Lion King Aang from...
This is definitely a case of immature types versus matured types.  Immature (Teenaged) ENFPs will be very idealistic and try to use their Fi to analyze complicated issues.  This is why big idealistic...

Analytical, playful, affectionate, pensive, and creative.

do you know if he likes his profession? It should be very demanding and free-time consuming I heard
That's what I read at least. In many states like Oregon for example, it's on the top 5 of most demanded jobs: registered nurses. If they can't / if they don't want... Many men also are doing...
true, noticed to late
or what's your opinion about nursing?  I heard that it shouldn't be too hard to find a job in this area as nurses are needed badly.
thanks for the recommendation, sounds very interesting. I will look up on this. Sounds like a life-long study time
3. English of course, German and Russian.  Wow seems like there is really not a big choice here...  And what about the economic/industry sector. 'international Clerk' (college degree) with work...
shortage?
Anthropology, translation/languages, any of the social sciences or creativity-demanding subjects?
but thanks about the honest opinion, sad to hear, but necessary not do go trough a big mistake
I tought about nursing, but that would mean no social life, no creativity, just learning and cleaning people...
no math or hard science, sounds like me.  So any other recommendations in a similar sector? Social work or something?
to be true, I am kind of jealous. I would love to study psychology but also some mental problems but especially money problems (I am 19 and I will work for some years now to get at least the money...

what's your opinion guys, is it worth studying psychology in north america? As far as I know ... you won't really get a job in this area nowadays.... any similar subjects or recommendations?
well I am ENFP and my hair colour is blue ^^
I tried to, but the result is too abstract usually, I rather stay with not-drawing bodies ^^
I have the same problem with bodies :) but there are usefull tutorials on youtube on how to draw bodies, for me ... they didn't work, I'm more into abstract stuff, but it may help you..

Thanks! But aww.. okay
This can be for ANY type! So I'm an ENFP I have  1st- Ne(Extroverted Intuition) 2nd-Fi (Introverted Feeling) 3rd- Te (Extroverted Thinking) 4th- Si (Introverted Sensing)   So if I had to get...
LOL, i mean i was like 70-80% T before but the fact that it dropped made me wonder
That usually happens with people but I never base my questions on how I feel I'm always honest to myself. People usually get different results because they're not honest and or their mood. Every time...
So I took the MBTI test again but this time I got Assertive only by like 4%. Personally I can believe it but is this true?   Can you change from being turbulent to assertive?
Wooo enfp teamm
Yes I definitely agree you should definitely work and fix your weaknesses
I get what you're saying our Ne makes us wonder and lose track of the world. But still I being a SF they love differently and they give off a different vibe which I personally don't want
Ah true but where's the fun in overcoming your flaws! But shoot I know ENFJ's and I don't know something about them I don't feel anything genuine.. but that's just me
No no you're definitely welcomed to do it too! I was just curious on the ENFP perspective.
Haha yeah I get you but I learned to control my Fi and I like how I can over come it from being awkward and not good at talking.
Ahahaha I agree that's something I want to get rid of but the thing is ENFJ have Fe and personally I like my Fi function I guess that's the independence in me meaning more I don't want be like a...
Haha yeah true true, but in my personal order it'll go ENTP, ENFJ, ESFP/INFP match up.
Hahaha I loved the descriptions you gave for each type and I have to agree
 Same but the thing about INFP I don't like is the idealistic side of them being too idealistic
I don't know if this is already out there but what I mean is like this.   As your own personality type and you HAD to switch one letter what would it be?   My Personal Switch (ENFP) If I had to...
well pretty much Angel explained it but I guess if I personally dislike someone, I just don't talk to them at all. It's pretty obvious that they don't want to associate with you. But if they're just...
Oh my gosh if this isn't me!! I love how you call it planning anxiety because I've been experiencing that so much my whole body wants to just have a complete spasm. But maybe that's just me..

Ahaha that sounds like a few INFP I know. But traveling through dimensions sounds awesome, you get to explore so many new things!
Oh yes this was definitely me. One time hearing something will not go through I have to be constantly reminded or it's HUGE pressure on me so I remember. But honestly the way I've gotten better at...
Haha thank you so much!
Have to agree when you see master procrastinator and tend to forget things.. It sucks because I always have to go back and forth
Haha sorta like a person you'll least expect
Ahahaha! Love the background information but what would you choose hero or villian?
Hey!  I'm not that new here but what kind of personality are the moderators?
I definitely agree with the things I quoted I hate when people think just because you might be a year older does not mean all of a sudden I'll respect you. One example is church we have leaders...
Soo true! I didn't realize that till now actually but hypocrisy and secret back stabbing can make me easily end a friendship.
So this this thread is going to be about if each personality type was a Hero or a Villains.   Powers?  Characteristics?  (optional) Background Story  I'm really curious on what you guys have...
Lol yeah I definitely did that but overtime and with help I learned to make smart goals instead of something I know I can't achieve. One example is if I know I'm getting my paycheck I make a small...
I can see why you call that a flaw but hey I feel the same way. I don't think of it as a flaw I just use it more as a way of describing myself and being just the way I am. That's how I view and that...
Ahaha the reason why I agree is because when I usually talk to girls I sometimes accidentally flirt and they start to catch feelings
Sadly this has been happening so much.. I could not remember to do anything and I just been stressing myself out.
Ahahaha! Agree! And it sucks when you think about so many good ideas but never actually do it..
Pretty self explanatory.  This might sound like my last post but anyway I'll start..  (:joyous:)I love connecting with people and how people open up to me so easily.  (:rolleyes:) I sorta hate...
Haha yeah I agree it's just something we're not good at but I think it's because our Ne just makes our minds wander
Wow thank you so much for sharing a part of your life like that and I saw how when they let you be yourself you really got to shine. Also I actually have an INTJ Dad and ENFP mother they got less...
Yes this was definitely me but I think this more towards it'll take time. So how I got over it I started to really realize (I also got help) that I need to get my shit done first. I learned to add...
Hmm I feel like we're all happy go lucky but we can be easily influenced to be depressed.  For example I'm naturally a Happy person but I had a lot of depressed friends, the key is to recharge before...
Yeah it's always fun to really be in our Ne mind but personally how I sorta delt with that is instead of just using so much on emotion and draining yourself, try thinking about more fun and creative...
Could you explain a little bit more because I still am confused with Si
Ah I feel you, but I hope you can be more of a you know a little about alot. If that sounds right
Yeah we all over think so that's what honestly really sucks.. But do you mean you hate being told one way how to do it and not be able to be free and do it your own way?
Omg wow I know exactly what you mean! I personally think it's because our Fi.
Hahah I feel you because the moment you let someone in your life that you thought you trusted just ends up being fake I'm quick to just cutting them off from my life. I don't know I feel like ENFP's...
Ahahah I love the sass because must not know! We ENFP might be nice people but you go too far they're going to see the true power of ENFP :exterminate:'"

ZOMG COMPLICATED. I'll probably need it explained to me several more times. Sorry. :[

Heyyy lady brah how goes it?!? ntm? eh whatevs yo.  Life's good brah. srsly.
Robert, I know about the cognitive functions, I have read somewhat extensively on them.  The reason I posted this thread was because after studying the functions, I realized I do not only use the...
*wince* I don't like asking for tests , but is there a better way to find out your enneagram numbers? I have absolutely no idea whatsoever.   What IS Enneagram? something completely independent of...
I feel like there is some kind of similarity that many ENFPs share in the eyes... A certain look we all have, a mixture of inquisitive, adventurous, mischievous and dramatic...
My unicorn nose isn't so sure. We need more objective ways of knowing! How do I *know* if I am zees ENFJ?
Good looking. lol
Unicorns are extinct, it's time to move on. I love your avatar by the way.
Good evening my friends.  I have long thought myself to be an ENFP, but recent developments seem to have shown otherwise. I've taken plenty of tests, and I'm not really interested in doing more....

WOOP ENFP selfies!  Here's a couple iPhone pics of yours truly.  89046 Selfie with new-ish haircut... This was during the summer.   89047 I think this is the typical ENFP smile right?   89048...
Oh... Also. Read the last few pages that made me think of a couple things.   1) sagging pants is the biggest evil when it comes to basic guy's fashion.   2) if my shoes are brown leather, then my...

Omg yes exactly hahaha. I definitely admire her for being able to do all the mean things that I would only think about and consider. She's like the embodiment of my darker side... So relatable :D
Aww thanks firelink :3 I definitely need to start coming on here more so we can have more of those discussions!!
Really? Haha I'm glad to hear it! I had just always heard her typed as an ESTP, and she seems so pragmatic and to-the-point, moreso than most fictional ENFPs would be
Whoops double post
Somehow I relate to Scarlett O'Hara in some ways, despite her not seeming very ENFPish
I tend to be ~10 minutes late for events that don't require me to be on time. Any more than that seems inconsiderate and I wouldn't do it - if there was a reason why I had to be late I would...
I think the lower level people obsessions can be somewhat cured by just having a breather period away from them and with other interesting people, yeah. That's happened to me a couple times. What's...
I definitely give too much weight to authority figures in my mind. I tend to resent them more behind their backs, but comply more readily to them than anyone else to their faces. Which makes sense,...
I think ENFPs in general tend to be really flexible and just bend, bend, bend... but there's always a snapping point. And our snaps are terrifying because we've bent so much.
I'm like.... 85.7% positive I'm a 9w8. I think I'm a bit more reserved than other ENFP on the forums seem to be -- I don't post nearly as often and I tend to lurk a lot. I think I read somewhere that...

From what I've experienced, it irritates most ISTPs when pointless questions are asked, because the only reason they perceive for the question is some invasion of privacy. Which makes sense -...
Whenever I communicate, I always tailor my words to suit the audience. So yeah, on forums I tend to give the minimalist answer
You know you're an intuitive when you randomly notice a huge blister on your heel, and then realize that you've been subconsciously adjusting your gait for a week because of this

Is an ISTP interested if they randomly text you after months of silence, when the two of you have no mutual activities and there is no concrete reason to talk?

If you get really excited when you first see someone (anyone), that's a hint that you're an extrovert -- even if once they start talking you get a little drained. There was a quote I read that was...
Yeahhh, I get what you're saying. Like thinking about the risk and people's potential reactions that could come from it causes you not to take the risk? Even though the risk isn't necessarily risky...
ENFPs have a very contradictory nature. We're able to appreciate practicality and idealism, we're capable of caring so much it hurts and two seconds later not feeling anything at all. We see so many...
I think MuChApArAdOx has got it. (I love that username by the way!) ENFP really, REALLY dislike feeling obligated to like someone. If someone is trying too hard to get us to like them, nothing could...
HAHA yes. I always have some innate sense of faith that no matter what I do, things will turn out okay.  ... And they always do. So, you know, it works out nicely.
Personal stories, funny stories, possible explanations for a third party's behavior, ridiculous ideas and possibilities, feelings, debates
As an ENFP, I can completely relate to the first half of that scenario. I think other people getting overly attached to ENFPs that are just trying to help them out, etc., is probably fairly common....
I agree with all of the above. I do the same thing as your brother.  It's not that I don't like my family or don't want to be around them - I just need to introvert when I'm at home. I need...
Hahaha I forget to wear shoes out all the time. Especially when I'm walking somewhere rather than driving.
Ain't that the truth
Oh man. I think ISTPs are SO sexy
I agree a lot with what Pinkrasputin has said.  I think that for ENFP, when we're with people, we tend to be in the moment. So when she's with you, she's happy and everything seems to be going well...
OP, I do the exact same thing.  It's either getting awkward and cold and distant and strange and I like the person for FOREVER, or I just develop a little crush and talk a lot around the person and...
You eat an entire slice of pineapple pizza before realizing there was pineapple on it.  On January 12th, you realize that the Christmas tree is gone and you don't know how or when this happened.

The most horrifying thing for me is how I somehow absentmindedly end up becoming the exact person that everyone in my life needs... and then I can't stay that person
Hi I miss you a lot and I don't know why we're wasting our time not doing anything! ...I really, REALLY miss you.
I'm good at English, Psychology, Philosophy. Those all come naturally to me and allow some degree of creativity, at least in my school. Plus they're interesting and usually relevant to my thoughts. ...
Maybe it's just because I'm young, but whenever I'm rejected, I start to doubt myself majorly. Even if it's just a perceived rejection.

^ Agreed.  Being around different people and interacting with them inevitably influences you, and different people emphasize different aspects of your personality. I think this is natural, and it's...
Hahaaaaa yes. And then I gesticulate wildly.
I'm always friendly, but I don't make any effort to carry on a conversation. I really dislike small talk :S
I would recommend asking the ENFP to meet in person again, and judging from there :)
In my experience, with ENFP and INFP, there is a notable connection that is clearly felt by both of them while they are together if there is any spark there. If they are together and the same...
I've felt it for ISTPs and sometimes INTJs - probably because they frustrate me so much trying to figure them out, and I am forced to throw all of myself in.  ISFP types tend to gravitate towards...

The best way to tell someone's type is by watching them in a live interview of some type, not by their movies or shows. I think Conan O'Brien is ENFP, as is Hugh Jackman, as is Jason Statham from...

Oh my god, IT IS SO NICE WHEN YOU HAVE THAT PERSON AROUND. it's fucking exhausting being uptight and cautious all the time.
Jung sees past the bullshit. He knows that ENFPs aren't all rainbows and sunshine because of the Ne Fi. It's Myers and Briggs that made us look like simpletons due to their simplistic system.
test as much as you can for yourself. that's the only way you can really know and you'll learn more about yourself along the way.

I'm pretty sure #2 solidifies the fact that you're an ENFP. We're often so open minded, our personal feels can be ignored for the sake of exploring new boundaries. Also #7 is a clear sign of inferior...
I generally just say that ENFPs are more likely to hold off on their values to explore the possibilities and the inverse.
so there's literally no way you should have got a different results since the test is painfully straight forward.
Working to assess which functions you use the most? Yeah.    wait, why are you so confident that you're an ENTJ?
Yeah, the questions are pretty boring, in my opinion, but they do what they're supposed to do. so, :T
Why do you think that it's inaccurate? Also, you pose a very good point about being in the Keirsey forums, but sliding scale tests like Keirsey's and MBTIs are so simplistic that they're inherently...
yeah, that's the only thing about this test. the pattern is so obvious. But so far, it's the best one that I've come across. Dichotomy tests are horrible, and most function tests are really long and...

Get in touch with yourself. Figure out the why's of your actions and behaviors of late and work on your issues. Also, most importantly, believe in yourself.
haha, so you're the jimmy neutron brain blast type. how do you feel about the claim that using Fe makes your Ti data more understandable? Have you found it to be true?
lol, à la Downey Holmes?
Making a logic understandable allows for growth of the original idea, which will actualize your idea even further. But, I understand where you're coming from.
but, assuming the code is for public use and access, it would make more sense to make it decipherable, especially if someone wants to improve upon it.
I don't trust anyone enough for that to be a possibility. Two friends are relatively close, and i've known them for about 5 years.

REVIVAL! What type do you guys think Eva is?
Yeah to be honest, I should rectify that, because life I said on page 2, ENFPs are really self conscious, but head strong due to Ne/Fi. I was thinking too logically instead of realistically, because...
Yup, it's the Ne - Si. Si I'd say we're like a tether ball thing; Si is our base, that's how we stay rooted, but Ne is the ball, flying all over the place, covering as much going as possible. Of...

Lol, thanks for the heads up. If she extended on it, i was going to move it elsewhere. My apologies.

Too much of his lore is about him crying and doing things out of honor and to clear his name. Doesn't sound very INTP.

Lol, they have an interesting sort of depth.
Yes.

Makes more sense holistically as an ESFP. His intuition is very lacking. His Te is tertiary. That's my opinion on it.
Man, I totally can follow all this.. but geez. It's not always the right way to interrogate, you could just ask the person if they meant it this way.. instead of constantly pushing drastically...
The funny thing about writing a character is that they can change personality types between episodes, literally. But if we view them holistically, we can get a general answer.
Haha, I grew up around an INTP an ISTJ and an ENTP, I'm definitely not sensitive in the least. Maybe only to myself. X3

Hmm, welcome! I'm an ENFP and I like cleaning and organization, I don't think it's that uncommon. (What is common, however, is ENFPs being scared of being pinned down to a type.) X3

My ENTP ex wanted me to be kinky but I'm not. Like at all. I'm not sure if it's because I'm an ENFP or I'm asexual. Probably the latter, come to think of it...
All the NFs I know find SJWs annoying and ridiculous. But I might just have really intelligent friends.
I'm asexual so no, definitely not. If I'm going to act on the minimal attraction I have and attempt to nurture it, I want it to be long term. I'm not interested in relationships that won't last.
My ideas come to me in a variety of ways. Sometimes it's through conversation. Others just pop into my head at a moment's notice. And sometimes I find little tidbits of knowledge I'd like to share...

Another writing question! How is an ISFJ/ESFP relationship? What are the benefits and downsides? What would an ISFJ like about an ESFP and vice versa?

I used to be really offended. Now people have a reason to hate me. Oh well. Go right on ahead and hate me.  Now if someone I care about were to suddenly hate me, that would be a different story.
Question for an ESTP character I know I've prattled on and on about but this is making me think:  Would an ESTP bottle resentment or not communicate what he wants from people? Bear in mind, mine is...
He's a jerk and probably a narcissist. A narcissistic ENTP is poison to an ENFP. Dump him!
He sounds a lot like my college room mate. Family is well off, seems to have a zillion reasons to brag, acts like a nice guy except he's really not. I hated her and I probably wouldn't like this guy....
No, it's not that I don't think ISTJs can be creative, it's more that I don't tend to run into many and there isn't much discussion on the subject. I find the imaginative and creative side of you...

Matilda because I saw a lot of myself in her and her situation. Something struck a chord with me about the movie and the book (which is better than the movie).
I discovered all of the things I hated about ENTPs disappeared when I befriended a healthy one. Never mind, you all are the best. Unless you're unhealthy, then you're total jerks.
This is probably the closest I can get to a definite motivation; Allie is telling Hiccup's son Finn why she was so brutal to Hiccup during their so called friendly duel.
Well this is why I've asked for help. I've made her a total jerk already and I think she's either ENFJ or possibly ESFJ. If an ESFJ is more likely to go with revenge, then that's probably her type....
Well as the plans for my final story have started to come together, I realized that the ENFJ jerk I'd been writing into my series would actually make a more interesting mastermind behind the...
I'm currently reading the first book but I think Percy is ESTP. Then again, he's also 12 so his second function may not be completely formed yet. Annabeth seems INTJ and Grover ISFJ. Maybe. I'm not...

Sounds intriguing, even if just from a reader's point of view. Is there a link up yet?
Good post...agree that some (including me) are not making the Fe/Fi distinction correctly. Though I suspect some of us here ARE Fe users too, but use it in a more immature way, slightly awkwardly. ...
Interesting...so we develop Fe to support Fi, and it's Fi which is actually calling the shots?
Yes if I understand it correct then Fe is about social skills, like being a diplomat...not necessarily sticking true to your inner beliefs, but rather doing and saying what's of benefit irrespective...
Despite the MBTI classification (i.e. that Ne and Fi are our main functions), does anyone feel like they have an awful lot of Fe going on?  I feel like considering other people, and interacting...

I know us ENFPs are meant to be all kinds of empathetic and stuff, but do you ever have trouble with empathy? Granted, I may be wayyyyy over thinking things (I tend to do that >.>), but sometimes I...

Hello INFP! I don't know what this forum needs, but my life needs many, many more of you!
My best friend is an ESTJ, but I think we're the exception rather than the rule. I am more naturally drawn to NTs, their brains fascinate me.
I don't know if I'll ever get married. I'd like someone to spend the rest of my life with, but whether that's a husband, common-law partner, long-term relationship, best friend, or whatever, I...

That's exactly what it is! Lol. I never really know what I'm talking about when I start, but then half way through, something clicks, and I win the conversation. :p

Please, take a look at this thread that I originally posted in the INTJ forum: ...
INFJ could be a possibility.. If he's using logic to display detachment and protect himself from vulnerability just as I use oversharing and expressing conflicting possibilities regarding my own...
ISTJ seems a little to lukewarm for this guy. He *almost* seemed like myself in that he could read people and seemed to have all their possible motives and intentions weighing on him. He's intense....

That's exactly what I thought, but his tendency to appear overwhelmingly arrogant and the constant debating and the logic and the contradiction all say INTJ.  I think he must be some type of TJ,...

Ahh the conversations in this thread feel nostalgic. In a good way. ;)
Unfortunately it is! It's a manifestation of spiritual bypassing, I believe. Seems more prevalent these days, perhaps because things like yoga and new-age self-help quick-fixes are all the range.
I guess when I use the term ego I am thinking about self-concept. Almost like a self-ideology, if you will. I don't think ego is a bad thing, I completely disagree with the idea that in order to...
Interesting.  I relate to the push/pull aspect but I'm not sure what my instincts are, lol. I suspect that contra-flow makes more sense for me but I've only really just started taking instincts...
Another thought, I think trauma reactions can often look and be mistaken for reactive types when viewed through the lens of Enneagram. That said, perhaps there is a conversation to be had about...
Interesting. Does this mean contraflow types are more likely to feel internally conflicted in some way?
Yes, definitely.  I'm currently in therapy and working on overcoming my own issues related to complex trauma and I have found that it has complicated my typing process. I've recently only started...

Enneagram is an interesting map of an aspect of reality. But it is just a map.  The map is definitely not the territory.
One thing I would ask is how much trauma have you experienced in your life? Sometimes, we protect against trauma through numbing (dissociation), and this can lead to impulsive and intensity seeking...

Well, anger is emotion/feeling.
You can be in denial and still think the world is full of evil. 8 is driven by anger, and something has to be driving that anger in the first place. They aren't apathetic like 9s.
the rest seem good
I would have thought the 8 response would be more intense/passionate (reactive type). 8 is about feeling as though the world has done you wrong, it's a very vindictive type and reactive type....

Cinton is just....hmmm. Well, she's a liar. Don't get me wrong. I ain't no Trump supporter, lol.  I think they all got issues that run deeper than typology.
There are similar patterns, sure. I don't think it's helpful to compare the types.
Stereotypes work from a disconnected and broad-view sense, sure.   You'll probably find that that when you start to get to know someone personally and intimately, that stereotypes fly out the...

Also I guess even I would go along with others' agendas to not be seen as a buzzkill, but that's about the only reason.

I'd agree that INTJs and INTPs are probably the smartest type. ENTJ's perhaps. But I lean in favor of the INTP's because of compensation. INTJ's can apply themselves much easier but suffer...
You can't just read the types and figure out which one you are? You can probably narrow yourself down to three, and then to figure out which is you, just think really hard about it.

4103: SLI-Si
Nah I think you're on the Si-Ne axis.  INFP or ISFJ is more likely.
Sp/so
Yeah you are correctly typed
ESTP 9w8 sp/so
9w1 5w4 4w3 sp/sx
No?  Which type would it better suit?  ^^Yes tinyheart  , you are very correctly typed
Well yeah, 5 is super introverted, but 4 is a double withdrawn type.  5 is withdrawn and power/control oriented (there's a better word for this).  717978  This graph (credit owlet ) does a good job...
Yeah because of the awesome signature
If your looking for the most withdrawn I'd go with 4w5 sp/sx or so/sp lol  SLI would be ISTp but ISTJ in socionics/functionally, the socionics equivalent of ISTP would be LSI.  I'm not suprised it...
Sx/so, maybe 6w7?  I could see maybe a 9w8 fix somewhere in there but I'm not sure  717826 717818
Could anyone see 9w1 so/sp (or 1w9 sp/so I suppose) for me rather than 9w1 sp/so?  I feel like 9w1 works and sp/so works, but together they do not work.  A lot of the 9w1 sp/so descriptions focus on...

ooh that's a first, I've never really considered Se in my stack (besides during my naiive INFJ stage).  What makes you say Se?    Also to poster above: perhaps

It seems there are pretty big gaps between female and male ENFPs, so I can only really comment to a point, but I get my feels hurt. Super easy. It causes me a tremendous amount of pain if I don't...
I resent those.   :tongue:
Thank my posts and start a discussion with me. I love it. And talk about yourself! Share fun stuff. I must say, one of my favorite ISTP traits is the *shares fun stuff* trait. I will usually...
Oh holy crap, no.  I am incredibly self conscious and hard on myself and tattered inside...my feelings get hurt at the drop of a hat, and I take everything to heart and so, so personally. I read...
I'm loving all this ENFPxISTP love around here today. <3 :blushed:    I'm having my dad bring home ground beef for cheeseburgers tonight. For obvious reasons. But then again, isn't EVERY day...
Nobody ever replied to you! D: Well, I'm going to.  I think these are spot on! Although I'm still going back and forth between ISFJ and ESFJ for Chris. And (Spoilers?) since the emotion lord IS...
Healthy ISTP's are no BS, straight shooting, fun to be with...mind always racing and creating like ours, but incredibly grounded. Help me stay grounded in reality. Which isn't ALWAYS fun, but they're...
Thank you! >.<   I love INFJs and ISTPs. A lot. ISFJs are pretty cool, too, once you get to know them. :kitteh: I tend to be fond of people rather than types in general. Trying to get over my...
There it is, then. Haha.  Free Jung + Enneagram Personality Test  This has been my favorite test by far. Even when I'm in my more withdrawn, introverted periods, I still test out ENFP. Which to...
Jeeze, everyone here is so amazing. I was not born with anything approaching artistic talent, but I taxidermied a rat last month, and I was kinda proud of him in his crystal--eyed glory. I kinda...
That's so weird. o.O  I'm not convinced we live in the same country.
I think Japanese and Korean are crazy pretty. Leaning towards Korean. I only know a few worlds and phrases, but I connect to that language somehow...I feel like if I was going to learn a second...
I'm a very new ENFP parent- and was parented by an xnfp as well-   Let's see.  My mother's shortcoming was definitely consistency. Nothing was consistent in my life except the lack of...
Absolutely. My evenings are usually spent having a series of comfortable silences with friends.
lol...where do you live? So I can stay far, far away...I hate being regulated on anything, you tell me my dogs HAVE to be schooled and have a stupid piece of paper to show it, I'm out.  -proud mama...
Welcome. :kitteh: I'm surprised you have social anxiety when you're tucked safely behind a screen. I have social anxiety in person pretty badly, but I always feel safe here. :D Good on you for...
It's a night for INTPs! :D That's a good thing. My dad's an INTP, so I'm a little familiar with you guys. You're great. :kitteh:  Welcome welcome! And get to posting. :D
Amused me. :D Welcome! Get to posting!
Haha, welcome, new INTP. :P We expect great things from you. :kitteh:
Dear ExFx child of mine:   I'm sorry I'm not everything you deserve. I feel like I'm failing you every minute in my own self-absorbedness. I know when you're a teenager and you hear the story of...
Familiar? Not really. It started the year I was born, and ended when I was 7. I was aware of it in the way you might be aware of any other piece of pop culture that doesn't effect you- 'lots of...
I don't understand enneagram as well as I should, so I don't understand the 'wings', but I'm definitely a 2 as my main number thingy.  I thought you might be, too. ^-^ I'm pleased I was right.    ...
I took some not half-bad selfies today. *shares*  http://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q740/Ahtaeki_Akuti/2014-09-07_zpsca3dfe34.jpg...
Thank you. :blushed:  Eh, I've talked about it till I'm blue in the face. I know I'm not telling you anything when I say I process by talking about something over and over until it finally heals...

As a teen, I thought facial hair was icky. Probably 'cause my dad's always had a full beard. As a grownup, I still think mustaches (on their own) are icky...but a full beard? Bring it. Go big or go...
I don't know, I have pretty high tolerance for both.   but this:    I relate to that, but it's more like...I become obsessed with people I'm in love with. I used to not understand why that...
*bear hugs back* I'm really glad that helped. I hoped what I was saying was what you needed, and not me just projecting onto your thread, haha.   I am okay, thank you. It's fresh...about 2 months...
Dragon, all the way. I like the idea of riding a powerful, potentially destructive beast through the skies...I'm not a huge fan of horses. I love them, I've owned them...but I'm kinda over them.
I spend my alone time with a close friend on Skype (voice), quietly doing our own things, every once in awhile showing the other something, or sharing a brief bit of conversation. Somehow this lets...
*applauds* ^Yes.
You just made me go all mushy inside. This is exactly why I surround myself with a few select beautiful, introverted minds. <3
1. Do you ever actually get over that person? I don't think so. after dating several other people and having years pass, I'm gonna say no. I've finally come to terms with the fact we'll never be...
You're not alone! I am with you there. When my mom left I went through this, 'can't trust people, therefore can't fully love people' thing. It's hard when people who you thought weren't capable of...
Pssh, anyone that really knows you knows you aren't actually being mean! Of course it takes some adjusting, but I love your teases. It helps me be more playful and tease back. :D
**hugs everyone**  Thanks for being xNFPs, guys.
Psst...it's masturbation.  Yes, I gave this exact subject way too much thought. :kitteh:  http://i1356.photobucket.com/albums/q740/Ahtaeki_Akuti/Bioshock_infinite_lutece_twins_zps11fd2d06.jpg"

One Hundred Years of Solitude, Flesh and Spirit, and The Republic. Depends on whichever one's closest to me. xD
Ahh, definitely. I love my NT friends; they tell me what they like and dislike about my work pretty bluntly and it helps a lot. NF friends are good for brainstorming.
I do write. I'm lucky to attend a school where the main focus is creative writing. A story is never finished but it is due. It helps with the creative output, but my best poems were the ones that...

YouTube - Endlessly - Green River Ordinance ( with lyrics)
Yes! We're not alone! It's an amazing feeling, isn't it? xD Welcome.
Of course. I'm very pleased with the headway my ninjas-in-training have made. Soon they might start hunting me.  O.o Now I'm getting paranoid...
And that's when we strike with our shurikens!
They'd be foolish to the point of bravery, so keep your guard up.
It wasn't me, it was the foolish assassins. Therefore, I propose we join forces and hunt them down.
Relentless assassins coming after me? That wasn't part of the deal.
Welcome, Ash. I challenge you to a Pokemon battle.  Ahem, I mean...have fun wandering!
Welcome! You won't eat my brain, will you? I like keeping it in one piece.
I dispatched them promptly and sent them back to base camp. Thanks for the practice. They should recover their memory within a few hours.  I feel honored to have joined a forum where the admins...
Breaking News: Don't Watch This, Folks. Viewers of the recent Oprah episode on assassins may be in peril. This is not a joke. Lock your doors, everyone! Actually, don't bother. From what we heard,...
But when they're interviewed on Oprah, they'll reveal who taught them, and your secret will be out.
And then they escape knowing how to strike without a trace...how does that make you feel, unleashing foolish assassins into the world?
Well, all right. I'll send them over and trust that they're foolproof.
Really? What methods do you use?
Yes, some of them haven't learned the proper way to throw throwing knives. I was quite disappointed when they failed the exam.
If you could show them how to properly dispose of bodies by feeding them to your sharks, it would save me a lot of trouble.
Welcome! I'm obsessed with typing my friends, too, but not quite experienced yet. :)
That would be lovely. I haven't had time to because my hitlist is backlogged.
May I keep some for my pet electric eels?
Yes, they do need a bit more training before I can release them out into the world...it's a deal! *summons ninjas*
Welcome from a fellow newbie. :) I don't think I've ever met an ISTJ in real life, but then again, I don't know my friends' types. Looking forward to seeing you around.
Great idea! Capture them so they can't run, then run away gloating. My ninjas-in-training could probably help with that.
It'd be a contest to see who's more introverted. I'm running away from you! No, I started running away first!
That's when you break out the Tabasco sauce.
Well, when the flow of conversation has been blocked, you just wait for it to break through again, I guess. After a couple of months without conversation, I'm sure plenty will be said.
Exactly. So any grudge they held against you for catapulting them to the moon would be gone, lost in the joy of conversation.
I'm sure they'll be very glad to find cell phones after going for so long without contact with Earthlings.
There's service on the moon?
Next project: build a communication device to ask them how it's going up there. [Feeling a bit loony, perhaps.]
I second that, along with reading the back of shampoo bottles.
Success. We have brought the art of puns to another species! Now, what other members can say that?
By Jove, that's a good idea! [xD It's like a disease...] *sets up catapult*
Yes, because then you'd have to eat your words, which isn't pleasant. *grabs shovel*
Could we bury them alive? Or drown them in Tabasco sauce?
Yes! You understand my punny situation!
The pelican puts me more in mind of fish than water, but water is there nonetheless. I see it! [See. Sea. ...Okay, the puns are tired out now. xD]
In elementary school, I was really shy and quiet, but in a setting outside of school I suppose I was noticeably more ENFP. Before I entered high school, I would never have described myself as an...
Thanks, everyone. :)  @mcgooglian: Yes, I'm glad someone noticed my pun. xD
And I'll add my tiny rivulet of water to it. :) I'm an ENFP. I've been interested in MBTI types for a while, and decided to join this forum after lurking about it for a couple of weeks. *waves* Hi!

When I'm flirting with an NT...
Two thoughts:  1. NTs are simply less likely to show when they are getting emotional. 2. From my observations it does take a bit more for them to get emotional than other types.
I love your posts. Articulate and I can always identify. Can you give an example of what's bolded? (That's not a word... oh well.)
ENTJs are uncaring, unfeeling assholes.  The thing is they don't waste their time on people that don't matter. (NT need for efficiency, anyone?) But if you do matter, they will move mountains for...

What are you talking about, ENTJs love being second best.
Beating around the bush, emotional manipulation, glitter.
I never have to worry about whether they're being honest, or wonder if they're sugar-coating with me. Love that.  p.s. love and missed the forum, and you guys :3

I also tested as SLUEI, I can relate to nearly all of those things on the list.

Tropical is Taurus, Vedic is Aries, and I act like so much more of an Aries.
I have to be reminded to act like a lady a lot. Mostly from my mother. I use manners and I'm polite but I honestly don't care if I'm being too loud or if I'm not sitting properly. I'd prefer to...
No.
I always get Neutral Good or True Neutral.
I'm doing pretty ok. I procrastinate a lot (I'm literally in English class right now, I'm supposed to be editing my paper), but I do pull through with mostly A's and one or two B's here and there. I...
I'm in high school right now (like, literally right now. I am typing this in the middle of biology.) and I get pretty good grades (Straight A's last term, except for one B in geometry) I have no...
I'm an ENFP. Sun is Taurus, Moon is Virgo, and rising is Cancer
I think it depends on the guy a lot of the time, really. Like, I'll either be super flirty and girly, or I'll try and act arrogant and mysterious, or I'll just play along with the guy and make jokes....
Ok, so I love this show as well, but I mostly focus on Mabel. I know a lot of the replies on here type her as an ENFP (which I completely agree with) but I see a lot typing her as an ESFP because she...
Yeah, no it's definitely ESTJs. ENTJs I can deal with for a little while, but ESTJs make me wanna throw myself down several flights of stairs.
I don't find myself being attracted to ESFPs ever, at least romantically. When an ENFP and ESFP are together, it's sort of like a big explosion of energy. So, it'll be fun at first but it will die...
I'm a little odd in the fact that I LOVE being in like big groups of people for hours on end, but when I'm with a small group of people, I run out of things to say and I'm ready to take off pretty...
Thanks whoever replied! I think it helped just to type it out and actually articulate it
Yeah, while I was writing this, I was trying to remind myself not to get too stereotype-y with the whole ENTP stuff, because everybody is capable of emotions, etc. Thanks!
Hey, so for the longest time, I've tested as an ENFP, and it's been super accurate. But, as of late, I've been noticing I'm a lot less feel-y. Nothing happened that would've made me less feel-y, but...

Preach it, OP. My mother is the exact same way. She always has this smug look whenever she says anything to me.
I'm gonna go ahead and agree and say ENTP. For a while back I was like 'oh, nah son. He's an ENFP' (I'm an enfp, so I just tend to automatically assume my favorite people are also ENFPs) but then I...
I have a friend who is an INFJ. Honestly, she acts like she knows better than everyone, thinks she's always right, and then gets bitter and irritated when she's proven wrong. She also tends to tell...

I'm asking how you personally relate to those concepts though. Like how do they factor/work together or against each other for you?   Yes, I'm in existential mode right now...
How do you relate to optimism, pessimism, and realism?

That's why I said Te is beautiful <3
They're always judging us. It's a fact we just have to accept with grace. Embrace it! :wink:

Thank you so much for the advice, but I am yet to find an INFJ in real life, although I now do know one online. My curiosity is satisfied for now:D
Thank you so much! This should be easy, then.  You definitely talk more with him!
We aren't 'life of party' we just, like being around people. Parties in fact, bore me a lot. Talking to a few people,  being in crowded places, just not being alone by ourselves is what we seek for.
Well, this is hard. I don't tend to show intellegence specifically unless I'm brought to an argument or I'm asked for my idea on a topic.
AAH Thank youu!! I feel flattered!   Believe me when I say, I do that, involuntarily but it happens, got in trouble many times because of it, too...  And you do deserve it!! Why wouldn't you?
True, that and how you guys aren't weirded out by us. Your acceptance means a lot  Ah, so cute! Congratulations, I think (a little bit late but...)
aww, that's actually cute :proud:
...k then.      lol, just kidding. If you are living in my dormitory, wouldn't work :P  Aah, I had loved you guys even before I met one of you.
Kinda, just can't get used to living in another room, that makes me feel like I'm in a capsule.   thanks for the new info! I should create more topics here.
Woah! Some awesome advice is that! This should be easy, I always look at peoples' eyes. Eyes are the gateway to ones soul. Thanks!

Get ready for the hugs then! I would attack anyone dressed in penguin costumes with hugs!  Or I am bad at getting them (most of the time)  Oh, sorry... I forgot we were on the INFJ page.... But...
5 mins!?! You need a reaaaally big chocolate. And maybe cartoons or some documentary (penguins and space are the best)?  Well... Maybe they are just shy? People are more comfortable on the internet...
Nah, I'm as still as a statue when I have a chocolate, so try at those times :D Aahhah what did the Finns do to you? :laughing:
ahahaha, nope, sorry. I'm in Turkey, but we use the same time-thingy, I suppose :D

You are right, my impatience about the things I want and my emotionalness are my weaknesses.   The thing is, I have this big, hungry curiosity for mbtis. I have most of them around me, I discover...
Well, INFJ are said to be the ones that complete ENFPs like puzzle pieces. I actually want to test it out and just fall in love even when I read their features.  And as I said before, I'm not...
Man, I'm pumped now! What to do with all those energy in the middle of the night?
Be....silent.... I'm only silent when I'm listening.  The problem is I have nearly all the types around me (and I smother them with questions) but INFJ, and I crave for one. *Sigh* I think all I can...
But waiting is so...long.  I just don't want to accept the truth....
well, that's good. Because I can't e like anything else. People told me to change a lot in the past- they still do. But I can't even bear the thought of trying it.
Ah, then that is why I don't understand. So am I,  but it is good to be like that for me.  Thanks for the help and the explanation!
Spark? From what ? Never understood xSxx... I feel strange with them. And can't really figure out what makes them S, which is kinda annoying, to be honest.
That's what we are, right? Inspirers. ;) Adventures are always welcome because having the attention span of a cat is really bad. We get bored so easily. Helping others with emotions, listening to...
But seriously, being unusual is something to value. You are unique, precious. And unusual people have unusual ideas, which are really fun both to act and ponder upon.
Well, INFJs are said to be our soulmates so I wonder how it would be...  Yep, ENFP here. I think we have this effect on introverts, most of my best friend are i, you guys are fun to be with, so...
I'm looking for a male actually. Why so rare...:sad:
I didn't find one yet so I'm not trying to get the attention of someone in specific. But what can I do to pull them at myself like a magnet?
Ah definitely! And as we ENFP can get rather... creative and weird, INFJs accept us, join us, and understand that we aren't just dumb, but have a unique mind.
I'm trying to deduce from my best friend, so: *Animals don't expect you guys to be with them all the time, so you don't lose energy while also not being alone. *You INFPs are mostly calm and have a...
ENFP one is not that true for me either. As much as I love crowded places and movement, when I'm to be on a date, I want to be alone with that person, get to know him better, probably end up in a...
I have never met an INFJ but just by reading their posts and their features. You guys fascinate me, all the way. Sadly, I am yet to meet one.... :unsure:"

Rofl, brilliant. I was told, You're such a woman! by a friend of mine recently. Glad to hear I'm not the only one. XD
I'm a strange creature. Not exactly T/F cusp, more like an F in disguise. I'm clearly an Ne dominant, and my Te is so developed and works so well in conjunction with Ne that I can often come across...

She knows, I showed her the thread as I was writing it and double checked to make sure it would be alright with her if I posted it. Thanks for the concern, though. I suppose I should have clarified...
TL;DR at the bottom.  Greetings, INFJs of Personality Cafe. I've some questions for you about the subjects mentioned in the title and how they apply to a friend of mine, but first I need to give...
So, let's get to it! My SO is something of an enigma. She's tough and hardy, yet moody and incredibly adorable (as you will soon find out when browsing the resources I've provided you with.) The...
Alright guys, first off thanks for all the feedback. Definitely seems like we're getting somewhere, though where I couldn't say.   Now, here's something else that may be of use to you. I took the...
Hmmmmm.... You make much sense. So the statement is that I'm comfortable with Te and therefore would be uncomfortable with Ti, right? Any chance you could give some good examples?   Also, funfact:...
I see what you did there. http://i240.photobucket.com/albums/ff32/evildrew81/scary%20stuff/Joker.gif  You ISTPs remind me of stealth fighters. ...
So what do we call it when one tries to consolidate the two, as I do?  I don't see things in good and bad or right and wrong necessarily. Not usually. There are a few occasions where...
Very astute of you, sir. So could it not also be Fe paired with Ti that simulates Fi? And dominant Ne paired with auxiliary Ti that might appear as Te?
XD Thanks for your input. Then this is not me. Also, you and I probably live nearby since we're having a massive cold-front moving through here as well. Here's how it works for me.   I walk...
Then where do these feelings come from, praytell? If not from emotions, then where? If it comes from the intuition, why not just be double intuitive?   Hi everyone, I'm grandmofftarkin, an...

I'm actually being convinced towards ENFP with Herculean Te. Talking to my SO who's a Ti dom, and she's pointed out that I'm too considerate of others to be very strong with Ti, that when she's deep...
*ahem* ...Well let's not get too terribly derailed, then. Could I perchance ask your opinion on this, TJ?
*chuckles* Perhaps the Feeler just wants to tempt me over to the Dark Side?   I've typed as F before, but never do anymore. *shrug* Had me worried there for a bit. Heheheh.
ENFPs are warm, enthusiastic people, typically very bright and full of potential. They live in the world of possibilities, and can become very passionate and excited about things. Their enthusiasm...

Nuke everything. Desolate wastelands are pretty peaceful, man.
.....My god.   But see, I'm so cynical. So... I dunno. I don't hold onto stuff like most ENFPs do. What I am is definitely very important to me, but what I can do is even moreso.   For example,...

Hmmm. So I've been analyzing my behavior a bit over the past little while. It seems like when I search, it's internal. My mind kinda flies out in all directions searching for relevant possibilities,...
Hmmmmm. And you sense Fi in me, do you? See, that's slightly worrying. I respect logic and reason and so on and so forth and seek to make use of them in any way possible. Buuuut.... When I first got...
Well, this was my second take, so I'd discussed all of it before and had a good idea of what I wanted to say. Perhaps that's contributing some?   Fun fact: The second video was actually a lot...
So you're saying that I'm more grounded than most ENTPs? Hmm. This is... interesting. I am intrigued.

Dionysus- estp. I really like him along with Venus.

I'm a Christian( born again Christian).
I'm 4w5 sx/sp. I figure most enfps are either 2, 7 and 9's.
I can't relate. I'm not like that at all. It because I'm 4w5.
My fave colors are pink- all the shade, lavender, white, black and blue.
So true. :happy: I hope for that one day.

It looks like I beat you to it!- NatetheGreat:laughing: But no, I never thought she was a type 4 until you said it. And I knew she wasn't a 4w5 like me, so 4w3 made sense.
I think enfps that are type 4 would use more Fi then Ne. For instance, I use more Fi then Ne that a cognitive test said I was an infp. Probably because I'm a type 4.  I'm no introvert. I believe...
Edward- entj or intj Viven- esfp

1) EXPLORE!!!!!! and be loved :) I think I prefer to give pleasure, and tease the partner, but when I receive I want it to be gentle and romantic ^^
I love this thread! Were do I find an INFJ lover?? :happy:
I'm sorry it didn't work out! You seem like an amazing man to me! :) And to me, part of being an ENFP spirit is the belief that the freedom of different lifestyles is SO important. Although I guess...
With an ENFP, don't take it personal if we use some time to reply. It's just how we are. Also, it's not so easy to know when an ENFP is in love, because we are so warm and flirty with everyone......
I agree with being very extroverted (Ne) and sometimes very introverted (Fi). Sometimes I shock myself completely, being the most quiet person, and sometimes I shock myself for opposite reasons,...

What you wrote in the first post is exactly how I feel. Thank you for putting it into words. You have a point, I didn’t mean that all judging was bad. But yes, I am probably a lot younger than you,...

One in politics (ENFP) on at school (INFP), one at a disco (ENTP) :)
Okay, so this is a known sentence describing the ENFP. I know it counts for me. So I thought we could discuss in which ways we have felt this way :)  For example, if someone ask me if I'm a...
Yes , mobile messages. Hm, so you wouldn't make an exception if it was someone you liked? And if you prefer phone i guess that goes for people you know a bit?
What do you feel about text messages? For example, if someone you didnt know that well texted you to hang out, how would you react? Are you the type who always answer them, or the ones who easily...

Thank you for helpeful insight and advice. About the green light, you are totally right. What would you recommend?
Okay, thank you. It sounds logical. About the politics, great. (Not for you of course, I understand.) One worry less. And about the flirting; exactly! Isn't that what this thread is about? :D  ...

Speaking of willpower, do any of you guys struggle with it? Or the lack of it, rather?   I have the willpower of a gnat.
So we got to talking in an ENFP thread about what ENFP's look like and there is debate surrounding the question of physical similarities and personality type. I am wondering if there are any twins...

Sure. That makes sense. How about a situation where all we've had is one date? I did hug him goodbye, eventually. I'll meet him in the next couple of weeks for a few days, but that's not nearly...

I think ENFP's would also be considered so-so. Most are not drop dead gorgeous (besides myself of course) but tend to shine from within. Our types are similar in we don't really care too much about...
Just playin of course. But on a serious note, I visualize ENTPs only so-so in the looks category. Once you guys open your mouths (which is usually quite soon) you become a lot more attractive.

This is a wonderful thread :)
From my perspective, a double major offers more options in case I change my mind.  On the flip side, it takes up time, provides too broad a focus, more classes, more stress, and uses more money.

you guys like ENFPs. best. you know it :)
I'm curious about your working style. I love working for myself, but I've had to get used to my energy spurts and work with (not against) myself.
the problem is, the ENTp is being themselves, and the ENFp gets offended. We are deceptively similar at first. Then the differences come up...the differences make the ENFp horrified at the ENTp (how...

I appreciate the responses, all. It's reassuring to know that's not an ISTP quality.  Is it possible that an ISTP who is scared about their future/scared of life in general/depressed, could channel...

It's an ENFP world. We are the ones who have fun and success and  can also benefit from being attractive to the people who are responsible, have lucrative careers and love us.
Intj's respond honestly to direct questions. It's fine-- and will save a lot of time and anxiety- if you tell him what you want from the relationship and ask what he wants.

She wants him to be dominant. You described him being submissive.
I don't think that being submissive is an INTJ trait as my INTJ is dominant in bed. He's laid back otherwise. I do think, however, that one can't change a submissive into a dominant or vice versa.
I love my INTJ's sensual, focused, highly skilled loving that's the best I've ever had. And I love the fact that he's honest, responsible, analytical, intelligent, funny and calm.
I like it that my INTJ is like a smoldering fire that erupts into flames with me. If his intense sexuality were more obvious, I'd have to fight off women to stay next to him.
My INTJ doesn't seem to get annoyed by my talking because I tend to be quieter than usual when I am one on one with him. I've noticed he really listens to me so I talk with him only when I really...
Blech. Well, the upside of that is that your husband didn't tell you that he fathered a child outside of your marriage, which is what my husband told me.

Therapy combined with medication is the best treatment for severe depression. BTDT. Severe Depression, like diabetes, is a medical problem, not something you can talk yourself out of.
Can you do your online work while sitting in coffee shops? I hated working out of home. ENFPs need the energy of being surrounded by people.
You are an enfp: use your gifts. Throw parties, take interesting classes and workshops; create events like meet up groups, volunteer. Enfps create fun. We don't wait for it to come to us.

If you were on a long flight, what would you prefer to do, ISFP?  If it is a short flight, would your answer be different?
Survey time.  How does your type prefer to spend time on a plane?  Think of the longest plane journey you have been on.  What's your preference?  Would it change if it were a shorter flight?

I don't know many INTJs who talk non-stop! Actually, I don't know *any* that does.  However, on a topic that they are interested in, they can talk sufficiently.
Oh yes, I forgot to mention that! :) Good point.  Do ENFPs ever completely forgive themselves?
Do other ENFPs do this? In areas of disagreement with the other, the progression I have seen is like this:  Passive (Compromising, bending over backwards to please) --> Neutral (Cooperative,...

4968: That's exactly how it is for me. I'm finally starting to grow out of it though, I think a lot of people can be like that until their early-mid twenties.
I would eat it and ask for another.
I went for my first run Monday(2 1/2 miles) and run again today. It actually wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.
You should never give an ENFP a dare because 99% of the time we'll do it.
I'm an ENFP and I'm getting the urge to just get up and travel again.

Someone type Beth! She's becoming more and more of a main character, as evidenced by episodes like Still (Just her and Daryl all throughout) and Alone. I'm inclined to think she is INFP.

I like talking over the phone, but the first time they call me my heart races. Lol I get nervous as everything.
Even a great relationship has its problems.
Regret. Do what ya want while ya can instead of looking back in the future wishing you would have done those things.
I'm almost always going to wait for the guy to ask.
I'm in band so I have my band nerd status and I take pride in it :)  I really hang out with everyone though, not just band kids.
I've heard way too many rednecks in my day being from the South and all :P

I love guys with tats..especially on arms. ;)
Honestly, I've been in love with this guy ever since I saw him 10 months ago. I really want to tell him I love him, but I don't know if he feels the same yet so I just keep it to myself.
I don't want just a puzzle piece because a lot of people just see it as a random puzzle piece. I want them to know what it is. I've actually thought about getting an entire arm sleeve of Autism...
Well I want an Autism Awareness tat for my brother..so in a way, it's more than just for me.
Hahaha, I do love makeup. ;D
Honestly, I want to get tatted...what do y'all think about tats? :mellow:
I used to be 20 pounds a fat heavier than I am today...so pretty much, I'm OCD about working out now..I never want to be that weight again.
I'm afraid of getting cancer.

My friends said I was the most trustworthy person they knew this morning. I want to be trusted so I don't tell their secrets like most people my age do. xD
I don't bottle things up...if I need to cry I'll cry no matter where I am. If something's bothering me I have to let it out...if I don't, I feel like that thing is eating away at who I am.
Awe! I want love...I told my mom that and she thought I was crazy. xD
Definitly tame. Lol, but fun. :)  I rather not risk getting myself into trouble. x)
Karaoke! :D Whoo! Hmmmm, the gym I go to at least 3 times a week...I love lifting weights. Yoga. :)  Music Festivals...film festivals...hanging with my boo thang and my buds. x)  I like school and...

Only 3 years.

I've only met one (known) ENFP who I found to be charming, a male. However, I myself am an ENFP, so perhaps it's an issue of not wanting to commit type-cest ;)

I'm very good at it. Mostly because I experience absolutely no fear, no matter how large the crowd is. I attribute my experiences in high school Speech and Debate to that ... attribute, of mine!
I don't think that ENTJs are misunderstood.  I think INTJs are misunderstood, though.
With INTJs, you are surprised by the intensity of their Fi.   With ENTJs, you are surprised by the intensity of their Se.  ENTJs understand people better, but care about them less.  INTJs are...
On average, INTJs are much nicer and much deeper than they appear on the surface.   On average, ENTJs are much meaner and much shallower than they appear on the surface.
ENTJs are definitely lightyears ahead of the INTJs in terms of being socially savvy, but also lightyears more likely to cause real emotional damage to other people due to inferior Fi.

I'm not super crazy about dancing at a club or a party, but I love to learn specifically structured dances and I do it often for exercise and enjoyment. What a Te answer.
Are you all really how they say? No. There are a very few people who perfectly embody the stereotypical view of what an INTJ is, and that is their genuine personality, not a persona they put on to...
Let me clarify that my friends don't tell me this because they're  mean-spirited or making something up, it's because I ask them. If I  think someone is a little shady, I'll ask one of my friends...
I'd go with ESTP.

Anyone who's familiar with Big Bang, the Kpop group, what do you think their types are? The other thread is kind of dead now so I thought I'd make one specifically for BB.  Though I've liked Kpop...
No, I don't think so. If there's any correlation, it's probably with Enneagram types.

Respected, sure, but liked? It's nice, but not if it comes with a significant price. Social presence and doormat status are two completely different things.
Thanks, I'm new to MBTI and didn't realize. /s  I've had problems with everyone I've been friends with. I've never been friends with an INTJ before, though...so maybe it's high time I go on the...
Well, isn't this a judgmental thing to say? I've had just as many problems with ESFJ friends as I have with INTPs. Maybe I should just stop having friends, eh?    Nice perspective there, I...
Do you ever get told that you don't have many traits that are seen as socially positive...in other words, that you aren't very likeable?  I have an ESFJ friend, one of my closest companions, who...

What kinds of things brought you pleasure before you fell into this mindframe?   It can be very difficult to figure out your type when you aren't quite feeling like yourself.
Well you could apply that to relationships too. It's all connected. You could certainly apply it to great sex. To every little action, there is a reaction.
Are enfp's seen as being shit at physics or something? I'd like to change that perception right now. I used to get A's in Physics in school. It was never a difficult thing for me to grasp.
It wasn't to be taken literally. It's just the way of things, that if someone is not trying to win approval and just being true to themselves, people are drawn to them like gravity.
I went through a similar thing a few years ago. I fell out with everyone and didn't like myself very much. Then went through a phase like you describe, where I couldn't stop introspecting/analysing...
Lead and they will follow. It's physics. :)
Dear World,  Check out this dude. I played a charity gig with him last night. What a legend.   Yours,   A very privilaged enfp.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWa0kuc36cM
Yeah I agree, that sounds more like Ni. The whole post seems more enfj than enfp to me.

Can I ask. Why pick catholicism? I was baptised a catholic and I have to say I find it the most backward religion of all of them.   It says in the bible that God made the universe in 6 days, but a...
Ha ha I thought you were male. I just spotted the looking glass that says otherwise.
That's hilarious. What a little treasure!
I think it's a hoot. It is a cartoon you know? :/
Well, yeah I was reading through it one day and I thought - that's a lot like Khys.   Another reason was how you described how you prefer Fe to Fi, and that an enfp friend of yours made you feel...
Cool. That's great. :)   P.M me with the final version if you like.
Ok, I took all your suggestions on board. I rewrote the song, it's not set in stone, but I think it's looking a lot better.    Thanks Leeoflittlefaith and TheWildCard You're help was/is most...
Yeah, he's an ENFj. She's an ISTj. They are duals.
You're an LSI/ISTj. Which explains why ENFp's make you feel bad if you spend too much time with them.  You may even be an mbti istj too. I reckon.  ...
I think Ti is like a biological code that lives in your brain. Like a formula or something.
Yeah, we've had our ups and downs. We were both seriously fucked up when we got together first. I should probably have been in a mental institution and he was severely paranoid. I think it was a...
Enfp's are very analytical. We're the most introverted of all the extroverts.
No, it was the general vibe I got from her post. The username was just another clue.
Are you sure you're not enfp? Your name seems very enfp to me, as well as your whole story.   Anyway, yes I agree, it sounds like he cares about you a lot. I've experienced the hot and cold thing...
Are you sure you are an istp and not isfp?
Yeah, small dog syndrome is annoying.
Ne is also to do with pattern recognition. We observe patterns, and if we see enough of the same patterns emerging we solidify them in our minds and relate them to some sort of truth.   A simple...
I actually never watched house, so I can't say one way or the other. But how you described it there, that does sound Ne/Ti alright.
That's ok. I understand. I don't feel insulted.
I agree with MissFixit You're feeling functions are weak, so the conclusions you come to with regard to feelings will more often than not be wrong. Our weaker functions are like retarded versions of...
I thought you were talking about a different kind of duality, but you are talking about the dual nature of your own mind, am I right?  Well, we all have compensatory functions running in our...
Ha ha, yeah that made perfect sense. It's not a blues song though, it just has a bit of a bluesy feel to it. It's actually quite quirky the way I deliver it. It's all in the delivery really.   I'm...
What I meant by contrived was that I was imposing my own meaning on the song, whereas I should let the song have it's own meaning. Since my best stuff seems to come from the subconscious.
I think taking what's available in the outside world is the Ne part, and putting the pieces together is your Ti doing it's job.  Ne seems to just have a good nose for what is new and exciting. It...

That's why he got out of there and moved to Cork.
The catholic bit. I was only joshing.   I agree with you on the Socionics front though.
That was a great post. I read Jungs Personality Types too. It did clear up a lot of confusion I was having before. He said that Ne ego's have Si running as a compensatory tool in the unconscious. To...
That's good advice, thanks.   I just checked out your blog. I liked the one Nothing happens in Belfast My dad's from Belfast. Andytown.
Yeah a bit like that.
That sounds like a crazy scheme to me.
Thanks! It does have a rough sound to it. Yes. I don't have a youtube video for it, no.
This is just the kind of feedback I've been looking for thanks!   The first one, I wrote when I was feeling particularly traumatised over a fight I had with my boyfriend, so I guess if the phrases...

You would be rather surprised at how absent minded INTJs can be, especially when it comes to sensory details. Actually, he sounds a lot like one of my old bosses who was an INFJ hahaha.
Nawww!! All the warm fuzzies are happening here. :kitteh: <3 <3 <3
Best thing you can do is just tell him how you feel. INTJs have this reputation for being rather blunt and honest so you'll have clarity either way pretty much from the onset... Well perhaps after...

It's a pretty fun dynamic to explore in my humble opinion though, as with any type, you have to find the right sort of ENFP to suit your temperament. Some are more sensitive than others and don't...

Check out all of the INTJ/ENFP topics and you will see they do indeed. We even have our regulars (bless their beautiful, mechanical souls).
And while we're at it, sticky it to a corresponding INTJ/ENFP thread in the ENFP forum. We get more threads (mainly started by INTJs) on the topic than you guys do here. ;)
Endeavouring to see things from and understand other peoples perspectives is a handy anti-jerk mechanism. Emphasising and stuff.
I'm not a fan of type incest I'm afraid. Fellow ENFPs don't tend to rock my boat. I do have some great ENFP friends however (both male and female).  On the INTJ spectrum, they're a pretty rare find....

Any types that are known for NOT enjoying making out?  Please tell me, so I can avoid them.
Meh.  I don't think the right word for ENFPs is exciting.    Maybe, intense, authentic, or interesting.  I'd say that SPs, especially ESTPs, are waaaaaay more exciting...
Yes!  We ENFPs tend to not be very good about routine but it's important to practice good sleep hygiene which is basically sticking to a routine at bedtime.  Eg. Turn off cell phone, tablets,...

Not particularly.

Yeah, I think that makes sense. Angry ESFP are way more hot headed (shows a lot of anger initially, then quickly apologizes for it) than ESTP in myexperience.

INFJs, you should share your feelings with trusted friends like ENFPs more. We can help. You don't do yourself any good constantly solving other people's problems!
ENTPs are not known for not having friends... of the ones I know none are really loners, and the brightest one is actually quite popular.
flourine of course I kid haha I just wanted to distract from the tension in the room between those people fighting over... something.
On the real though ENFJs can be the worst if they're smart and morally skewed/screwy, see Hitler et al.
flourine you don't have an ISTJ friend. If you did you'd already know they don't have feelings, just the rules of the culture they grew up in.
Yall stop fighting now. It takes all types to make the world go round. Except ISTJs. Seriously, fuck those guys.
Yea we're both pretty awesome types.
What is there bad to say about INTPs? Seriously like we've never been best friends but I can't think of anything to criticize. Maybe you think too much? I do too.

I know I'm a way along the road, but I have very recently experienced my emotional reactivity meter goes from chilled to stressed-but-plastering-over-the-cracks-and-in-denial to...
It often happens when there is too much going on, and when management are to busy to help!  I went to a really helpful time management course a few years ago and the guy took a glass and half...
As a lonely, geeky teenager in a small town with little freedom, I watched many thousands of hours of TV and recorded on old VHS so I could re-watch things like Blackadder, Red Dwarf and fragments of...
Totally scatty, I have developed various methods of out-witting my inner self destructive personality.  Set all your clocks fast.  Leave the house 30 minutes earlier than you should.  I now leave all...
oops double post :(
Dear anonymous, You did it!  Your did it!  I never doubted they would want you :)  I know you were terribly sad about the interview and thought you'd completely stuffed it up, but I knew you would...
Dear anonymous, I'm hoping I've finally reached the end of this road and I am turning a corner and leaving you behind.  It hurts me to think of you and know for all your words there is nothing...
Yup, I am mess incarnate, but there is a tipping point of chaos at which a red mist descends and I become a tidiness OCD monster for a few hours.  If I'm going to clean, then I'm going to CLEAN baby!...
And be prepared for it to take a long long long long time.  From my experience, INFPs have a totally different experience of time  They are not ignoring you, they are simply in themselves, happy in...
I am mess incarnate.  I give messy people lessons in chaos.
Dear anonymous,  Thank you.  Thank you for being who you are and replying and caring and being so very dear.  Now the monthly blur of hormonal paranoia has subsided I can see just how we fit and...
Dear anonymous, Tonight I have a new houseguest.  Someone I don't know well, but I know well enough to want to invite into my life for the next few months.  Tonight we drank tea and caught up, and...
And your response brought tears to my eyes and made me laugh.  Hugs to you fellow ENFP, we stand shoulder to shoulder with all our idealism to take on the rigours of being grown up xXx

Dear anonymous INTJ prick.  You are rude, supercilious, arrogant, patronising, misogynistic and unpleasant.
The few Extroverts I've dated I found really annoying!   They were all E*T* and I know now, avoid E*T* missus, it's not going to work, for me at least.  I have always found shy, quiet people...

She is not easy to help, I thought I would go to the source... :) It seems part of the irony, that ESTJs are not happy in seeking help.  The don't like 'failing' so you really know they're cracking...
Thank you EmmaGilbert, those all sound like very good, simple, positive suggestions.  I know venting is a big thing for her too. There's often a not-so-muted scream out on Facebook and I always...
Hello folks,  I have a really amazing ESTJ friend.  She is one of the most determined people I have ever met.  She works every hour of every day.  She has the most remarkable reserves of stamina...

I recently went to visit some very good friends and as part of my visit their two little boys helped me to clean my car.  My car is always a dump.... I live in it for work, it's full of equipments,...

Dear anonymous,  Definitely hormonal, and I know that means I'm not seeing the world quite right.... and I'm tired to boot, and that's another foggy lens to peer through.... but I still can't shake...
Dear anonymous,  Wretched hormones, and wretched Christmas break, and wretched messy house, and wretched paranoia.  I was so cross with you.  A little miffed over Christmas, but sort of not...

Greetings interstellar_overdrive, welcome to PerC.  Plenty of tree-like threads for climbing here :)

5377: I know an ENFP when they are LATE for their appointments - or simply opportunistically double scheduled, knowingly.

Are ENFP's generally bad at managing money? - or just deliberately bad at managing it because it doesn't hold as much value to them as it does to others?  I have an ENFP friend that spends like...

You really expect someone with such experience to write a biblical page on that (because that takes serious effort to explain properly), while you only devoted two meager lines on it? :p   And as...
What about your enneagram 7 though?   And don't ''they'' say that INFP's don't doubt about being INFP's, but that ENFP's doubt about being ENFP's/INFP's or not?  The only thing that kept me on...

I'm not sure yet about ENTJ's, but I start to feel like it is probably better to forget it - OR - I will still run into my very dominant female crush <3  Other than that I'm still interested pretty...
Don't say that :shocked: everybody will point fingers and nod their heads and say: ''yeah, typical nico, that bastard always being a type-racist to everyone!!''
Classic.  and heartbreaking. Losing your Fi-works is just ..... frustration and mourn level 1000.  At some point I started to use Word to make a draft.
*laughs*  These sort of revelations and thoughts are awesome :laughing: I can so relate. Makes me giggle.  *pats Meg on the back* - but you're a great kid though, I hope your parents give you the...
These sort of threads always generate the ''standard appropriate correct'' answers that sweep MBTI off the table. Everything with everyone is possible whenever. Yeah duh, but those are boring...
I especially love the last one MissAl - so radiant! It looks so good on you! :)
I'm emotionally dominant, but sexually ideally I take a very submissive role if possible / compatible. I usually end up being in the submissive role while actually still controlling the situation...
but that in turn totally emphasises my message in the literal sense as you took it initially :tongue: haha
Clearly, but you failed to understand the approach. I asked if such statement would be effective (to activate ENTJ brain and engage, thought that would be obvious... :p expected different response).
As a kid I was pretty crazy. Wanting positive attention from others and be none like the others, I was the class clown. Wild (bad) ideas and trying to get others to do things I wanted to try/explore....
Well, then you failed showing that to me :tongue: or i'm oblivious to it. Anyway I wasn't being sarcastic this time.  IT WAS COMPLIMENT OKAY TAKE IT :shocked: ... DO IT, TAKE ...
Same for me (except for the parties), though I have learned that you can also ''train'' to become more energetic and resilient to have energy sucked from you. I believe my low tolerance for other...
Yay Meg! :)  Now i'm really eager to know how that convo went :0
What, why?  :sad:
Lord Pixel - couldn't handle?
You've always been kind, honest and humble - i cant fight you :crying:
Oh that basically means they looked for an easy way out to deal with the necessities and obligations of life. Especially works well for women too. No need to fool yourself with that :p   But sure,...
I don't think i'm interested in fighting for the attention(-span) and interest of an ENTJ. Go impress yourselves.   Will this do? :rolldeyes:

so eager.  but, this is a veterans battle.
WHO !!?   it's time to kick the 4 off the eternal throne, and that 9 sidekick. more balance more interesting
so many 2s all over the place all of a sudden thats very good
I feel some similar language in here yea :p awesome!  - and whoa, from ESFP to ISTP is definitely new territory! Must be exciting and super interesting! That's one of the things I have been thinking...
This is where it gets so interesting! Because i've had this discussion before in a way. It is reversed for me, compared to you. When I don't love someone yet, I can't be in a relationship and won't...
Thank you for your reply :)  Well first of all :P  ... if that is you in your avatar than you kind of look quite like my ex, which makes for a bit of irony.    How do you mean that you haven't...
I want to chip in on this.  Full grown beards? maybe when i'm 65 in my case  Also, admittedly i'm skeptical too about your height, Eefje :p  you don't look 1.73m - I will have to verify sometime....
Lemmy - it looks very nice, and cheery! (can I use that in English? In Dutch i'd say ''vrolijk'' :)....)   :proud:

I will always find ways to make something useful out of your chaotic mess. Don't accuse me for misinterpretations then though :p !!
You're bright though, i'm very confident that you will be able to figure this out yourself - not to mention the 'fact' that the whole world except me loves to to read (this is a defensive way of me...

hehe :3 - well do not worry my one *takes away restless brain*, it's okay, no need for the extra discussions. *auto-fills*  Sorry, I didn't meant to seemingly imply you in that story. Maybe I...
Haha, that is good to hear! And you know what? This is that kind of optimistic, hopeful, confident, positive and cheery energy that can be so attractive in/to other people. I believe that if you keep..."


5379: 'While yes you could talk about the carrots, but that would be just as true for the ENTP. We both use Ne as out primary function. So the fact that you would have strong opinions or ideas about a topic...
Yeah, Go saffron! That was well said, concise, and accurate. Especially that bit about the dollar being over inflated, spot on! I'm impressed. Thank you for having the energy to do what I couldn't!
Not me. I think I sound terrible. If you know about sound design I feel like my voice is muddy on the lowends, and not very clear. I kinda of want to see a speech pathologist.
I am mistaken for a T quite a bit. I mistook my ENFP best friend for a T-- but then in retrospect I see how he is totally an F-- We tell each other, i love you. On the phone. (we are two straight...
I am the worst when deciding plans to do with people. I offer no advice.
I would have to agree with the out of sight out of mind thing. It can be pretty bad for maintaining any long term friendships that are separated by distance.
Have you ever been a public setting where some one says something so outlandish yet with such conviction that there is just absolutely no way to attack it? I mean the argument is just so nebulous, it...
I got 54-- but yeah, seems like an invalid test to me.
Hello Tine,   Yep. I am in hollywood and loving every second of it. I think if disciplined enough this is an excellent place for enfp's we are great story tellers, or we at least know great story...
Oh I almost forgot.   Book Of Eli-- What god awful movie. I hated every minute of it.
My three worst movies of all time: 1 Gummo, Harmonie Korine is absolute hack!  2 Bully 3 Employee of The Month  That being said I wasn't a fan of Avatar, LOTR, The Hangover, and a lot of the...
Actually I think there are some major points missing from this conversation.   NF's generally look for true love, that's true with me.   Ne is about possibilities and connections, and is very...
Yes, twice recently. I fell in love on the spot. And (which is very uncommon for me) they are both potentials right now which is driving me mad. Choosing one is not choosing the other! And i have a...
ENTPs only think they can do that, ENFP's really can.
Can you spot the ENFP in the video. Although, to be fair there might be multiple ones.   But I am in it, so there is definitely one.   Oh yea and this is an obvious plug for the project, but you...
Haha this is great. Actually two of my closest friends are both ENFP guys.
I think you should just jump right in. The more you write the better you will get at it, don't put it off. Also, my process is to write a plot outline, then write from that-- but don't be afraid to...
Can you expand on this?   I will have to say when I feel a connection, it is usually based on witty banter and playfulness rather than ideas.  I love having shared ideas but, the playfulness /...
^ That seems about right.   I know some of my close friends thought I was a T, and one of my best friends who is and ENFP I mistook for a T. It is hard with Fi to because it is so personal, I am...
Haha, I know what I have to do. That's the thing, I mean I'm 25 I thought this sort of thing would stop happening by now... Yea, I do realize how irrational it all is. Oh well, I guess the only thing...
Okay. So, I'm super weird. I've had one relationship in my life-- In High School. Very Short.  Ended terribly. Now 10 years later, I'm still single but I met a girl... And I fall hard.   I'm NEVER...

There is something about Kristen Stewart that I find very appealing, though. I think apergers is in the vogue right now, and getting way to much attention.
yes of course. According to wiki socion it is described as such:
Hi error, I find your post fascinating. I was raised Christian/ Jewish and there are parts of it that I love, and parts that I do not. I was thinking of trying a UU church seems very inviting and...
This is interesting to me. I just  realized that ISTP and ENFP are ideal, dual relationships according to socionics and I think it makes a lot of sense. I have always been attracted to the ISTP...

Making something that is complex seem over simplified resulting in bigotry, with a false pretense. So a statement like, ohh those radical Egyptians just want to establish a Radical Islamic state....
Oh yea. I played games like that well until I was older. I played games that were mainly from pop culture so every one one had shared experience to draw on.   I must've been eleven or so, and can...
It is so relevant, how can I not...   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zc4e-HdlhPY&feature=related
Cough, write, gone.
Haha, yea I tend to believe things at face value. And if I find out some one has ulterior motives I'm pretty shocked about it.   But I would say that I filter petty, scheming people out of my life.
I am right there with ya. I want to go skydiving really badly.
I was wondering what V-day was lol..... I thought some odd things really fast.
I don't know... Hmmm. I guess I have a very developed Sensor ability because i grew up with a S older brother. That means I was very athletic did 5 varsity sports and love being active. It seems like...
Oh yea.. Thats right I was thinking ISTP... oh well never mind.    The only person I know that might be ISTJ is some one who strikes me as very odd, and some what unattractive... a bit of a cold...

I don't really find you weird at all, you're actually pretty normal. You were the one that said you were weird creepy. I just pointing out there is nothing wrong with being weird. I like weird lol.

Most INTJs are awesome. Except for  HumanBeing, he's weird.

I would share a box of Oreo cookies with you. Too bad you don't live near me.
I'm constantly reminded of the age difference in the ENFP section. When I read something I'm like that's got to be a teen or early twenty years old because that's something I would have said or done...
This is the only post on the second page I can agree with.  I tend to also bond with only one person at a time for relationships. If I'm with someone the other menu items fall off and all I see is...
This is the only post on the first page I can agree with.   First, I don't become enamored with every good looking guy that walks by me. In fact, if a person's first response to me, ohh wow what a...

Thank you for clarifying because as a 2 I did not understand lol. It was like he hinted at some stuff I do and then I would wrinkle my nose at other parts. Sometimes I even stop to check my reality...
I think I laughed at this harder than I should have. Got to love an ENTP perspective.   http://replygif.net/i/590.gif
I'm pretty satisfied with my life. Maybe you're a young enfp. I also try not to lie to myself or others. I do agree we are constantly evolving meaning I put more value or oomph into my life stories...

I was more of the lines, shocked to it as a pinned topic in their section. I didn't know the ENFPs grabbed the ISTJs attention that much to be singled out for a pinned topic. Interesting. *Scribbles...

I'm assuming that's a trollish answer or are you actually serious about that philosophy?

Yes, I can become extremely ambivert. It really depends if I know anything about the subject they're talking about. I also take a back seat to more aggressive extroverts. It sucks because then all my...
I don't find that selfish at all. I also inspire myself. I'm both a writer and an artist. I think songs and certain music will inspire me on a piece.
I giggled at this. You sound exactly like my best friend who is also an ENTP. He can't stand the ESTP that is in both of our lives. I get along with the ESTP better but we're both kind of like aggg....
ESTP I have the hardest time getting along with but I'm still holding out to liking one eventually :D.

My INTJ husband loves me. This I'm a 100% certain on. He also can read me very well. :blushed:  As to other INTJs loving me, I would be completely unaware of it.

My best friend and business partner is INTP.   Yes, we could talk for hours. We always help each other out.  I am blessed with his friendship.
Just from my personal encounter..  I have a good friend that is ENFJ and co-worker that is also ENFJ.  What i could say about them, they always strive for perfection. I have to wait patiently if...
Hahaha.. Its sure cool to snuggle in your bed in the morning, but theres so much work to do. Have to get up and chase my dream ;)
It was fun right @RandomBot ;)  When i first read it, i think of ENFP  and sharing it here.
My favourite pastime hobby, now hardly can find time to sleep all day long.  To all ENFP who likes to sleep :)  https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=193658437659154&id=154109934947338

One of my close friends aka business partner is INTP and we get along so well :)
Just believe in yourself and start doing it :)  You will do great!
Dancing by yourself will surely boost your energy and mood.  Dancing with your kids will surely boost our energy and mood.  Like to dance to music once in a while :)
Hakuna Matata!  Don't worry of what other people thinks.  What is important, you know that you are true to yourself.  Time will tell.  Life goes on :)

I think you should INTonyP , because before this I thought I have a crush on INTJ after I make him take the test really shocked with the result. Different contrast :P
Thanks centralman for everything :)  I pray that one day, a hell bent ENFP will look into your soul and find beauty in it.
Hahaha.. Vinniebob, thanks for the wish :)  Pretty sure you are excited about the movie ...  May The Force Be With You too.
He is ENFj rezo.
I am okay Lucyyy :)  After finding out that he is not INTJ, it feels much easier to let go.  He is ENFJ.
You are right maust, I must not use my personal judgement based on my INTP friend .
Don't worry qingdom it is just based on my personal opinion. Each INTP is unique. Maybe this is just my INTP friends traits.
I agree, that is what I felt with my INTp project partner.  The synergy is so strong, whenever we met. we would usually have non stop of conversation and lots of idea and creativity would come out....
Sorry INTonyP it is just my personal opinion based on my INTP friend . Maybe you could be INTP just a unique on :)

I don't think you should completely rush out to find an ENFP guy.  Give it some time, you have plenty of it.  I say just wait it out; one will eventually come in your life.
Pretty accurate in my case.  People assume I'm an aimless, wandering idiot because they know I have the P, but I'll be damned if I don't have my priorities together.

IEIs kind of get on my nerves too, tbh. I only know one that I know of: My brother in law. He is also a E4 though so maybe that has something to do with it. WAYY too intense, grudge holding,...
I much prefer my semi-dual (SEI) to my mirage (ILI) personally. I have zero appreciation for Ni and I find it kind of annoying. I find SEIs very pleasant.
No idea what your actual type is...  6w7 8w7 2w3 sx/so
My guess is EII.
I don't think anyone's ever going to agree on this.  Personally, I believe MBTI is shit and you shouldn't base your socionics typing on MBTI. Learn socionics and then decide what your sociotype is....
Triple positive. I don't really feel triple positive though. That has caused me to mistype for a long time. I'm not really a peacemaker because I am a core 7w6. I can be pretty aggressive.
I think my parents caused mine and my sister's types to an extent. My mom was kind of abusive and narcissistic (a 7w8) and I responded by pushing back so I wouldn't get lost in the background. My...

Healthy sixes are super amazing. I trust no other type. Jk sorta. 3 would be a close second, then 9 (with personality), then prolly 2.

I've been revisiting reinin's dichotomies and I'm pretty sure she's actually merry...  Perhaps she is ESE with strong Si subtype or she is just an SEI.

My fiancee is a 3w2 and I am a 7w6. I don't know how I would do with a 3w4 to be honest, though like threes in general. I do think 3w2 and 7w8 is a good pair as well.
I'm going to play devil's advocate here and say I don't think you are either of these types. I definitely don't think you are Ni dom. I see very little Intuition in your posts. Have you considered...
Do you know which of your tritype is your core Etype?
It's so easy to just type Hank as a 1 and leave it at that, but I still believe 6. And yes, definitely superego. Sp 1 and phobic sp 6 can seem very similar. I think Hank is more security concerned...
I don't think I know anyone of a super rare combination, but I have an ISTJ 8w7 friend and one of my cousins is INTJ 3w4. My stepmom is ESFJ 9w1. My fiancee is ESFJ 3w2. I don't think any of those...
Also I think it is fairly obvious Lockheart is 3w2...He is just such a flat caricatureish version of a 3 that he totally lacks the actual depth of a 3.
It could have gone any way really, 7 5 or 6. She certainly has a variety of interests though and is very adventurous for a 1.
My sister is 469 and ISFP. I have a friend who is 469 and INFP. I would think those would be the most common, but INFJ is probably pretty common too. Really any introvert, especially feelers.

Very much so! I was still always aware of how people perceived me so I hung in the background for middle and high school or secondary school is what you may call it?   Having a conversation with me...
Adding to our album :) All less than a year old 357418 357426 357434
Not that I'm aware of lol. I was told I said some weird things. Guess I didn't have a filter back then :D Honestly college is when I really started finding myself and was able to find some friends...'"


5595: Just curious if any other enfp or other folks ever get this way.. I recently broke up with my ex. I know my sadness is from loneliness not really.. Losing him. But I find Myself becoming increasingly...
it's weird. I feel most.. alive? around people, but then I get in these moods where I'm like. I don't want to see a single person because they take so much out of me. I mean it lasts a few hours.....
or am I completely killing all of that from posting this and trying to connect with someone :/ haha. but.. I am physically alone! and that is enough for me.
I've been in a sort of 'dating' mode and have been meeting new people all throughout the week. connecting and searching for a connection with them. I know that's how we get our energy but do any of...
the helping people thing is also a big deal. the job I'm at now I've been at for 5 years and I don't feel like I have any depth there or do anything to make a difference in anyone's life and it is...
I can't find anywhere anyone's suggestion or experience as an enfp being an emt.. I'm just curious as to how I might react in the field because I'm seriously considering this job.  it's exciting...
ugh!! this is exactly how I feel haha. everything goes great, thennnn... and I also just emotionally withdrawal after they confess their love or something. I do not know why. It's not on purpose. and...
haha. I don't think it deals with me being immature. I'm quite mature for my age. I just think I'm afraid of settling, and once I realize, wow this relationship is getting pretty serious after almost...
I am 22.. lol. I am starting to realize and think this as well. I think as a younger teenager or whatever, I was so scared of being alone that I was afraid to realize all the possibilities and stay...
haha well this is my like 2nd 2 year straight relationship, and another was off and on for 2 years. ugh. it sucks. I feel like I'll never be stable! I dunno if it's me or if I just haven't found the...
I feel, as time goes by.. it's harder and harder for me to stay in long term relationships. I'm always wondering, what if, and all this.. if I was with this person, or that person, or what if I was...
I really like what you are saying, I feel that you really understand where I'm at in all this. makes me feel like less of a bad person. lol.. I don't want to settle but, I hate breaking up with...
well not this weekend but last, I went out with my friends. like he told me to do. and when I came home late, he had locked me out of MY apartment that I pay for. my phone was dying. it was 40...
Yeah when I talked to him about it he said he knew these things he just didn't know how to change them. but I'm more of an action oriented person. if I don't like something, I will try to change the...
this is pretty much how it is for me.. lol. I've had the same job forever and keep moving up. he's had the same job but doesn't try to go anywhere with it.  BUT!!! update! I said something to him...
so what'd she do? tell him to move out and grow up or what? lol. or were they not living together?
well he's always been that way. I think I was so fascinated with him from the get go because he was so quiet and mysterious. I felt he was so deep and profound, and I love dissecting people and their...
nice quote.. haha. good show ;P I think he's just unintentionally selfish. yesterday, for example, I forgot my lunch at home and had no way to leave. I texted him and he said 'I'm sorry'.. because...
but I don't know what to do. I know if we start this discussion it won't end well. or he will 'try to change' but I don't want to change people. I'd rather them want to change themselves. because if...
lol I can't get him to do much. I wanna go out with my friends. we do. when I bring him along, he doesn't talk to anyone, including me. I ask him what's wrong, he says nothing. but then later on...
I've just been supporting and encouraging him from day one to try to get somewhere. he 'applies' at places, but that's it. it only does so much. and he is so set in his ways. fine with doing the same...
I think he is too, but I do care for him, and he is nice. I mean he does have random asshole moments, like most.. people, i suppose. but overall he's just really laid back. I perceived his...
I feel like it may be my enfp personality getting bored again.. as I often do but try to avoid.. ugh.
my boyfriend and I have been dating for almost 2 years now. we live together. everything was fantastic and is still not so bad! he took the personality test and got an INFP so I was like, cool! we...
haha! wow it's funny you said that. I heard him for the first time like.. yesterday?! ever heard of porcupine tree? or king crimson? and I like when bands can make a ton of albums that all sound so...
I can't help notice a pattern in the love of the lyrics most of these bands provide. some of them, it's just for the amazing adrenaline rush from their sound. i.e. the metal bands. my whole body goes...
I think this is the least accurate thing about me as an ENFP haha. I am sooo tidy! I clean every friday at LEAST! and I thoroughly enjoy it. I turn on some good music, and clean my whole apartment....
that's how I feel! depends on the people. if I'm dragged to a party of a friend's friend or something like that, and the people get on my nerves.. I become cranky and very very introverted. I'll...
I feel like I've heard or read a lot that enfp's are the most introverted of the e's. I like to party, but I do like smaller groups. I like being able to connect with everyone there.. and that's hard...
I hate how I think too deeply about things and always wonder 'what if' or about the different possibilities. (i.e. the name..) lol.  wondering about how well or how poorly things could turn out make...
Welllllllllll.. as an enfp myself, I had a boyfriend who cheated on me. it was long distance, 3 hours apart. he cheated on me with a very large girl addicted to crack with a baby, who was 4 hours..."

Infj, almost telepathic communication. A healthy infp, the emotional connection. Istj, like oil and water, but very loyal.
If I like someone my act becomes more silly.   If being withdrawn, nervous or perhaps even overtly friendly...for me its usually how I behave towards someone I am not into.

My last relationship was with an (female) INFP.   INFP and ENFP can sense each other very well.   He should stop trying so hard to make you feel better and instead start being himself.   Not...
Isn`t this a classic ENFP dilemma. We value both people and freedom. I think you could improvise but not compromise on this issue.
If I play out the ENFP card without censorship then there are always some who can't take it.

Too bad there is so much Fe out there, which either forces you to hold back on Fi, or be yourself and end up disturbing the sweet Fe harmony.
Amen to that!..   +1 to much of the other things you said too!

I am not surprised that enfps can relate to VSL but of course its not exclusively related to M-B-types.

Music and arts are actually both areas where the VSL`s thrive.  I never enjoyed geometry, geography or physics. Algebra and chemistry came a bit easier, but I never really enjoyed algebra (or...

Pffft please be careful not to go too far!  Do you think that griffins would be an SJ type? They seem to fit well.
Yeah, I was thinking maybe ENFJs for eastern dragons?  What if you walked normally whilst high? Like you became the opposite of yourself D:
Eastern dragons are FJs to me! Most likely NFJs to me!  Yeah, I just leave people be if they don't get me. It's better for everyone!

No, not at all. I met very nice people in my life, which had great impact on me, when I met them on social network. It's just, that you can know person better when you meet him in real life.

Thanks. I can't express how much I appreciate this. This one post really cheered me up a little. :)
Why must the insults of others (even a single person whereas everyone else thinks otherwise) affect ENFPs so much? We care so much about other people, but that only causes us MORE pain. It sucks when...
I heard about Ne on one of the tagged threads on either the ENFP or functions main page.
Thanks a lot. I'll keep this in mind. :)
Thnx this is good advice. I actually have noticed the sensitive spells getting shorter, which is a plus. As far as overcomplicating function goes, could you explain how Ne works then?
Wow I know that I've heard some of this stuff before, but you just laid it out so well. That last part though. How do you know it's getting better?

5862: 'I think it would be cool to be ESTP. I wouldn't mind being ENTJ either.
Favorite Intuitive Type: ENFJ  Least Favorite Sensing Type: ISFP
Hmm, you all present very interesting and valid responses. It may be true that Thinkers cannot feel happiness for a long time, but Feelers also feel sadness and other negative emotions as much as...
It hurts to even think about this question. If I want to be my friend, I feel self-conscious. Otherwise, would I be rejecting myself?
Do you think that Ts and Fs experience happiness differently? Is one more likely to be happier than the other?   This is an interesting topic that I suddenly thought of.
The more you read and learn about MBTI Theory, the easier it is to just know that a person is XXXX or he or she fits a certain description.
Anyone care to explain emotionally vulnerable? Does this mean crying or something of that nature?  I thought that ISTJs are generally not too emotional people.
ESFP (Mom) + INTJ (Dad) = ISTJ (Me)
I would definitely say an F would struggle with this type of thing. Their words do not do their emotions justice.   Whereas a T, on the other hand, say what they mean and mean what they say.
When everyone else is crying and you don't know why.
A good ENFJ friend has brought me out of many troubles and always knows the right thing to say.
I drink milk for the protein. Easy way to get your protein in the morning.
Now that I think about it, this does happen to me. And it is the exact opposite of what I want to happen, for nobody to listen in. I guess this just means that I need to try to talk more. Bleh
I don't get why you INTJs are all haters. Personally, I'd love to go to Disneyland. How can you not have fun?
Yes, I did not see it as hardcore abuse, no. I just don't see the point of joking around or teasing anyone.
Haha, I'd rather be around a PMsing T woman than F anyday.   I really feel like F Women get really worked up and find drama in every little thing.
I would place most ESFJs in Hufflepuff or even Ravenclaw.   I think ENFJ would be more Gryffindor.
I will be graduating high school (FINALLY) at the top of my class. Looking back and seeing now, all that pain, well, it was worth it.
Messing around with people is not exactly my idea of fun or funny. Although I do take a lot of it.
When I was younger I really liked younger boys. Now I am older and more mature, younger guys seem rather immature. I'd rather be with someone my age or older.
I don't have anyone whom I can completely confide in. However, it is nice talking to my mom because she is a sensor and she always tells me the right thing to do.
It'd be cool to be an N and be all smart and analyze everything. But I guess I'm happy with who I am.
Nice job Zster, I applaud you for remaining true to yourself! I see you have great passion for your work.
I always enjoy a good deep, intuitive movie just for the sake of depth. It's a nice change of mind and quite interesting at times.
I think anyone who has a normal career in this day and age needs to be at least somewhat of a J to meet the needs and fulfill the duties of the job.
I guess it's the same with people hating stereotypes. When you generalize, you stereotype.
Haha, you ESTPs crack me up. Now lemme get back to my studying.
To forgive another is to do oneself a favor.
I guess this has happened to me. Keep in mind that people always welcome a new friend and sometimes a change can be fun and interesting. ISTJs are extremely loyal friends and they will remain with...
Pretty much ignorant people who are not accepting and people who always want to hate. And the government.
Hmm, seeing ISTJ represented by older ages, do you think that ISTJ might be a type that results from maturity and age?
Distant past. I long for how things used to be. And the future is too unpredictable.  TV or Computer?
Most Likely to succeed: ESFJ Most Likely to become rich: ENTJ Most Likely to cry for no reason: INFP Most Likely to say I told you so!: ESFJ Most Likely to adopt a stray animal: INFP Most...
I have at times felt guilty for not acting appropriately during emotional situations. At the same time, T women can stay calm and think during these situations.
This is all so fascinating! I'd like to get an understanding, even the slightest insight, on how you guys can do this?
I feel that I would enjoy being in a relationship with an ESFJ.
I've actually used MBTI to transform into a type that I'd like to be by adhering to the characteristics of that type.
I know of ESTPs who are hardcore competitive. They're quick and observant.
Generally if they are smiling genuinely, it's nice and I would appreciate it.
I knew of an ISFJ that was basically taken advantage of by a few of her peers. It is the need to belong and the Fe that is their weakness.
I took the test and got the result. Later as I learned more about my type I realized that it fit me.
Being an ISTJ, I think that it would be pretty hard for us to come up with threads we wouldn't make.
Marijuana is legal in Europe, where the drug abuse rate is must lower than here in the States. If it is legal people will be satisfied with just using marijuana. But since it's not legal, once hooked...
I'd say I'm more Realist. It's hard to be optimistic when you are focused on getting the job done and doing it well.
I've currently been in a rough relationship with an ENFP friend. Forgiveness and understanding can change everything.
Currently I'm hanging out with some girls because I have never approached or been approached by any guys. I think having guys as friends is great because they don't have so much drama.
For me, the thing about having a roommate that bothers me is always feeling like I should talk to them or say something.
ISTPs don't freak out, even when things go wrong.
Haha I sit with my legs crossed this way too. It is rather masculine.  Also, I'm seeing a lot of people on here with bad habit of procrastination. That seems not very typical of ISTJs.
For me I crack my knuckles a lot, especially when I get nervous. It's really bad when I'm taking a test because I get these sudden urges to crack them but I try to make myself not because it's really...'"

ok, I believe you :p  I do the same thing often too (screwing up little details). Must be an Ne thing (or the lack of Si thereof)!
You mean you have Ne, since ENTP's don't have Ni? Not saying you're not an ENTP, but you could also be INFJ.   Ne (ENxP) usually keeps on expanding, constantly generating more and more...

I'm sure the stereotype is accurate for some people, I was just advising you not to base your type off of it. All types go through depression.
Cool! SO do you have any idea what your personality type is? I love intro threads, because if I'm talking to the OP, I can't go off topic.
