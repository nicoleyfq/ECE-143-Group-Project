ENFJ Puns so many puns.
Well I personally don't go that much for attractiveness in general but I can see you have the will to change that and that's good already. May I ask if you want to be with them in a merely sexual...
Sorry, not an INFP but I'm really into post-rock so I had to post :<  Going to leave this here and sneak out D:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usHC-O1BPCM
Welcome!!!
wrong thread D:
That doesn't sound very ENFJ I think x3 I'd never act cold towards a romantic interest. Those just get my warm side I think. When I like someone that way all I want to do is to just straight to them...
Not really, I'm mostly a guitar player with a bass obsession, I'm the person who ask for the bass to be louder or at least more relevant. I like trying new instruments and sometimes add them to a...
Guitar mostly :O But I can add bass, glockenspiel, harmonica, drums and ocarina.
AHAHAH I'm sorry but I'm laughing so hard. It really IS a plague. I never thought that was possible.
Mostly because of the sound. If there are lyrics I'll obviusly consider them but I listen mostly to Post and Math rock so I don't care too much about words.
HII! :D And welcome!

Hi there fellow ENFJs!  I was wondering how do you deal with direct conflict within the groups you're in.   When I feel like someone doesnÂ´t like me that much and starts to bother me a lot I just...

Sorry, not an INFJ but as an ENFJ I can kinda relate to this. If I'm getting your point right, I think low self esteem is transversal to all types. I do have quite a low self esteem and I'm a people...
the friend says welcome D:  HIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII! :DDDD
I don't think it's an INFJ thing more than just social behavior.  Maybe you have something good that makes other people jealous. Maybe you're pretty, or smart, or get along with people they want to...

OH MY GLOB. You understood what I was referring to with that Beefy comment. I think we could be wonderful friends. Thanks for clarifying about type too.   Are you a Mexican food fan?
To be honest, I could care less about acts of service. Although I think all displays of affection are filled with good intention.
Also, It seems that my type doesn't show up, I happen to be an INFJ.
Yeah, I'd like to order 2 beefy cheesy's with a medium cup of water on the side. Please, no ice.   But yeah, nice to meet you QrivaN.

Powerful and compelling arguments! I'm sure you've convinced everyone. Pretty amazing by the way, ever thought about going into politics?
My eyes have been opened now, I see the light. It all makes sense! Ground breaking!

Pressure, coercion, or betrayal? No way, I would never do that. Surely some ENFJs would, but they'd have to be on the dark side of the force, if you see what I mean.

It's because ENFJs use Fe-Ni and ESFJs use Fe-Si. Both types have a different relationship with reality, past and traditions, they aren't going to judge the same way.
Well it has some gory parts. The Ten Plagues of Egypt have nothing to envy to horror movies of today.
That's the reason I mistyped as an INFJ first. It was quite hard to know where I got my energy from, because of the draining phenomena. But ultimately I realized afterwards that I got too much of a...
Yes it is. I think you just need to make sure to tell your ENFJ that you aloofness is just part of your nature and that it does not mean in any way that you don't care for them or love them enough. A...
It depends on what you mean by that. ENFJs are known to need sufficient time alone because they generally invest a great deal of energy into their relationships with people: friends and family but...
Every ENFJ is going to be interested in the human psyche to some extent, they would not be out of place in psychological studies, so you are bound to found some of them there. That said, there's a...
You are probably right in both cases, I hadn't watched the series in a while. I rewatched some bits and your typing made more sense.

Yes, and they're not so much different from ENFJs, quite a lot of similarities, so it's no wonder that you'd think about him.
Possible, people usually type him as INFJ though. But INFJs are still Fe aux, still strong Fe users.
The best example would be Regina George from Mean Girls, ESFJ. I think the movie speaks for itself. Manipulative, two faced, enjoying tormenting others.  I think Constance Langdon from American...

hmmm thanks thats a good point about jealousy ill defiantly keep that in mind but what about clinginess?
So I will admit to being the smothering jealous type, I get a bit obsessed and clingy when in a relationship. From what I understand this is typical of enfjs, how have you people kept from doing...
A big thing about enfj's is we try very hard to please everyone, from my experience if I dont like someone its usually because I dont feel the success of making them laugh or smile, it makes me feel...
hah and what exactly is that suppost to mean? mr. random ill have you know it was a gift so I did not choose the color

indeed i do, its blue
but if your too loud they will bite meeeee :sad: :happy:

... yes but shhh not so loud they might hear you
other then the commitment issue what about an enfp and enfj?
you could try to find an outlet for your feelings, I listen to music while writing angry/sad/frustrated letters to whoever got me unhappy, I have yet to send one but it works really well, and then I...
I just heard you get angry quickly and react intensely, but hey :) things you hear are ment to be proven wrong
bad experience?
what do you become? oh and your aviatar is incredibly scary haha
hmmm well that makes sense, although suppressing your emotions is not good I guess we can just hope the force is not strong with you
oh haha well then yeah thats probably it :) hahaha next time he disagrees with you just I love you too
I have heard it too haha but I have no idea, let me know if you figure it out for sure
I have been guilty of doing this in the past, my reasoning was the person I always sided against could take it but I knew if I disagreed with the other person it would start a tremendous fight, then...

haha I was beginning to think I was the only one with a thing for hands
I think its the fact that enfj's genuinely care about other people's problems so when someone looks into their eyes they see true compassion and that could be somthing there not used to
just try not to step on anything that could potentially cause major damage
well normally this would be a compliment for a compliment but I dont know enough about anyone here to give them a genuine compliment so how bout instead you just say the best/sweetest/most pride...
I really don't like my appearance Im pretty short and I have a skin condition that makes it look like im blushing whenever I am anything other then completely calm, if people compliment my appearance...

I was wondering (as usual) and every MBTI type has its stereotypes, right? Now, when it comes to us INFPs, what are the stereotypes you've seen? Do you find it hard to be an INFP because of them?...
When in all of a sudden you have a creativity attack and you just HAVE to do something about it.
When you talk to yourself all the time.
It's hard to be a hundred percent sure about it, dear.. But I'd say it's hardly a pick up line assuming INFPs seem to run away from patterns when it comes to flirting. At least this happens with me.

Scientific, Sympathetic, Blithe ,Humorous, Fairy :).
Pardon? :)
This is the opposite for me.. When I watch TV programs I feel so much secondhand emotion I may cry.
INFP sounds very right, I get a huge amount of Ni dominance from you :)
They're all extremely beautiful! I would be most likely to wear, the wave palette! :)
Yes, definetely! She almost has that 'fake it till you make it' way about her, and is very talented and aware of it, but she does seem as though she is someone who uses many personas! Also, I...
Lovely actress! I thought I saw ENFJ in her but I could be wrong, she might operate on Ni-Fe though :)   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD5y0G6WaSI
I've all of a sudden had a huge revelation about Lea Michele, and think that she could be an introvert, she seems to have that sort of forward image and friendliness that a very well adjusted...
Any more opinions? :o
No, I understand :) I was just wondering what made it different so we could maybe decide.  In terms of those types, I highly doubt she posesses Fi, and that she is not an Se dominant :)
It's not off base :) Thank you very much!
ENFP and INFP are the same functions but in different orders.  In terms of if Belle is an extrovert or an introvert, her being extremely unhappy with the life that she lives in the town, and wanting...
Right, but why? :)
Very true! :) They also seem to interact more like ENTJ and ESFP rather than ESTJ and ESFP :)
Ni tends to take a lot of things and bring them together into fully fledged ideas.. I always thought Tiana's view for her resturant was very Ni, but I could also be wrong, I also think Naveen is...
Not at all? She was always looking towards the future and using what was happening around her in order to propel herself towards the future she wished to achieve, of course her father was the guiding...
I always saw that at her using Se-Ni. She's comfortable with making plans and embarking on the journey it will take to get to that plan, but it is not as though she is content with her routine.
Surely she's an ENTJ? :o
Why? :)
Oh well, you surely deserve to feel very proud of yourself :) You are an amazing human being, I really hope you're having an okay time :)
You are so welcome! She's a wonderful actress! :)
I think she's reserved, when she's on camera. Even then, she isn't really so reserved, she's bubbly, and quiet but not necessarily completely energized by herself, she also was involved in shouting...
Gatsby, surely operates on Fe? And lacks Ti?
I'd say she was an ESFJ. :)
Hahaha, that's very true. I could see him as having dominant Fe though, however.  Does he lack Si? I don't know, perhaps his planning could come out in things like his whole tirades against Harry,...
Isn't he an ESFJ? :)
She's also in Elementary, and is absolutely great in that.
Yes, definetely! Well xNFJ can be charming, ENFJ are called suave often, but it's in an extremely different way. She has that sort of Se in the moment charm rather than that ENFJ, I feel for you and...
Well it's the same functions but in a different order. In terms of just dominant functions, she doesn't really seem to be anything but a Se dominant to me.   She has all of these hobbies (fencing),...
I think you absolutely nailed it on the head. :) His whole 'I shall make jokes, because they're funny to me' is just so ENFP.
Why not?
I am a massive fan! :) She's not an ENFJ or an INFJ :) She strikes me as an ESTP.
Alright, I shall check those things out! Thank you :)
Thank you so much for replying, no that is not me :) That's Lynda Carter, who is extremely gorgeous I agree :)  I was thinking it could be Fe, sort of overexposure to feelings? or something? :)
How would you like to be helped or comforted, as an ESTJ? :)
Dear Reckless Summer Nights,  We at the ENFJ forum, love you just the way you are completely. I am so happy you are finding a way to explain yourself, and help yourself line up with yourself. And...
For some reason when I'm down my self-esteem plummets, it's really unhealthy. I will be absolutely fine and have built myself up incredibly, but then I'll have a caffeine or a food crash or be over...
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxBIQnwdqc0  This way of transforming her emotions into dramatic symbolism and using this to communicate it with her fans strikes me as Se-Ti.
I don't understand why tertiary Fe, can't be strong? While performing surely the main functions she will be using will be Se and Fe, which seems to suggest really realizing and connecting with her...
Sorry :) I was trying to illustrate that we could take the things she said at face value.. :/
You have to keep in mind that, these things aren't always the same. She makes songs about John Mayer and Harry Styles, because she seems to use writing as a way to express her feelings, which relates...

The two people I'm closest  and tell everything to are my INFJ 9w1-4w5-7w6 best friend and my INTJ 6w5-2w1-9w1 brother. I think Ni doms make amazing friends with whom I can be myself with and get me...

Of course! I didn't mean to imply that. I was kind of going on the scenario of not being able to persuade them otherwise, having already tried. I should've been clearer.

That's cute! Let him wear what he wants. Girls can be tomboys, so boys can wear 'girl' clothes. Shoes are no big deal. If the other kids didn't tease him, nobody's getting hurt.

I'm not sure. I tend to vary between knowing what's best for myself and forgetting it, fluidly. I can't seem to work out any correlation of the timing/type of situation, though.
I've noticed some of the ENFJs (myself included) are listed as gender neutral.  So, here's a gender test.  It's quite long, but different from the usual agree-disagree scale test.   Here's my...

dear INFP friend, good plan, why don't you just insult everything I believe in? sigh. sincerely, chickpeaax.
Sometimes I just really, really hate human nature.
I do tend to think of things as being 'other people' and then 'me'. But that's probably because I do think differently from most of the people I know. They're constantly telling me I'm weird. It's...

1.How do you act around romantic interests?In person? usually kinda shy. I have to be confident enough that they might feel the same way because then it's easier for me to flirt without worrying...
I am called shy a lot by my family making me think that half the time I can act slightly introverted when I don't know how to act in a situation.   I'm probably more patient than the average ENFJ. ...

I like behavioral humor. e.g. The Office (US). I like comedic voices, manerisms, reactions to pranks, and people making them selves look funny.  In fact, if a person tells a joke I don't really...
You know you're an ENFJ when you pick up on other ENFJs trying to get people excited over things (that they really don't care about).
I love this cartoon!
Really appreciating the responses every one, keep them coming! This is proving to be quite interesting indeed.
Thanks for your submission and comment iisu I plan on posting the results from my blog on to the thread, and will make sure that every one will get to see them. In terms of finishing the study, I...
ENFJ - Pretty much all rock except for most 80s and 90s, alternative, indie, some classical and don't mind some metal core once in a while.
Some ESFJs I know typically take introversion as being shy/lazy, you just need to explain to them how being burnt out physically and mentally affects you, and they should understand. Play on their Fe.
I left the lined option open, I'm also interested to see what colour pen people use too!  Thanks for your submissions every one, and to upload a picture try using imagr, and then linking it to your...

I know an INTP and an ISTJ that are good friends. They are quite similar in their interests, and in their social interactions. Obviously two quite different types, but it seems plausible.
I've had some minor conflict with an ENFJ female. Not direct conflict in as much, but having them control and guilt trip people around me as well as being self absorbed.   I've come to the...
This interacting with the energy flow that people invest in an outer agreed upon value is true in group situations, and some individual ones. But often times it works past an outer agreed upon...
I could go into detail, but there are probably others who will comment who can explain it better than me.  For me, one of the main distinguishing factors is that INFPs are 'different' (different,...
Thanks for the feedback!
I think Italian is quite beautiful, but of course everyone's taste is going to differ.
I've had moments where a friend is about to ask me a question, and I somehow already know it. As though I've seen it in a dream or vision before.
I think you have mis-interpreted MBTI.  People disagree with me when I say you can't change types, but to go from INTJ to ENFJ is a very far strech.  Being abused would cause you to behave and...
(not an attempt to hate on INFPs, don't misread this post)  I feel as though I am the only ENFJ who shares this view, but what is so special about INFPs?  There are a plethora of threads about...
An INFJ friend of mine gets sick now and again because she works herself a bit too hard.  They say the mental affects the physical.
Start some new projects, that'll get your courage to build up. Start working out, exercising, writing, drawing. Find a hobby and pursue it.
What I would give to be able to study Frankenstein..
I would be blunt with your boyfriend and tell him how much it's affecting you. If not, you could move out until the ESTP leaves?
I'm an ENFJ and can relate to both of these points, and going off some of the other stuff you said, you definitely seem to be exhibiting Fe/Ni - leading me to believe you are an NFJ of some sort.  ...
Although you're now banned, like I said it's more of a subtle thing, and often times I think it's almost subconscious since it goes unnoticed.     It depends on the ENFJ, some are better at it...
'Manipulation' is the wrong word for it, I see it more as persuasion. I believe that in cases it's not a conscious manipulation that we perform, it's more of a subtle thing. I can't give specific...

Thank you for saying what I had no motivation to say, I completely agree.

Yes, it is exhausting to put on the pleasant social face when you are sad or angry about something.  I agree that we live in an isolating, alienating society.  It's sick.

But shouting for the heck of it is all the rage now.  ;)  I just realized I need to watch more French language films.

Oh yes, this INTJ told be multiple times he doesn't trust people with things important to him, and does everything himself. I guess I should follow his example.

I, an ENFJ, can be overly sensitive.  My ISTJ of 13 years is blunt which at times can be taken as being insensitive to my feelings or critical.  I'm learning to not take everything so seriously from...
After looking into tritypes, I've discovered why I have this uncanny connection with 2 INFPs in particular.    I'm a 2w3 8w9 6w5 one tested both 3w4 or 4w3 (there 4 and 3 were equal) and 9w1 6w5...
Let me know if this sounds correct.  9w8 2w3 7w6  The peacemaker w The challenger, The helper/The achiever, The enthusiast/The Loyalist  I bet you do well with a high 3 in your life because...
Where are your results?  It should be a table listing the percentage of each number.
I tested high on 2 and 3.  I'm higher on 2 so I'm a 2w3.  The test I took gives me my high scores, so the values I listed are the scores that I tested the highest on.    Thanks for the links by the...
OK, enough of me denying myself:  I'm a high 2, 3, 6, 8.  I figured out my connection with my INFP friend.  We feel connected because of my 2 (The Helper) which she lacks and her 4 (The...
I highly recommend paying $10 for this test.    Enneagram Test - Riso-Hudson Enneagram Type Indicator  It's more accurate and it explains your types in more depth.  Good luck!
Thank you for the book recommendation.  I will definitely add it to my book collection.
Okay, a good friend corrected me and said having a 4 isn't possible.  Ugh!  This tritype is hard to nail down, but I feel like I'm getting somewhere though.  I do think my testing of 2, 3, 8 is due...
Your parents sound like they were in the unhealthy stress stages of the Enneagram during your childhood.  For the record, my dad was a lot like your dad and mom and I'm pretty sure he was in a very...
By the way, nothing to take personally, because I discovered that those values are actually my stress state, so normally I'm a 2, 4, 6.  I tested 2, 3, 8 because of my childhood experience triggered...
Thanks, Jawz, for your story.    After taking the full version, I actually tested as your least favorite person.  I tested as 2 being the highest with 3 and 8 being the same second highest.  I can...
BTW, here is a link to a more accurate test, if you're interested.  It has around 150 questions and cost $10.  I highly recommend it because it pegged me and was very informative.  It also talks on...

It's weird but I never felt a power struggle.  We are protective of each other though.    The only thing that I've realized is that we tend to want to help each other, rather than ourselves.  You...
I feel the same about my INFP friend too.  It's so dang uncanny how we get each other.  Thanks for sharing your story.

Completely alone without being around humans, animals, internet, or texting--not a chance.  I have to at least have my canine companion.  I need some type of companionship even if it's only my dog. ...
Welcome to the forum, sephora.  Thanks again for your post.  It gives me some hope that my ISTJ will not cut out our niece and nephew from their life.
Thanks everyone for your remarks and comments pertaining to my situation with my ISTJ.  I really do appreciate it.  I think we've talked this subject into the ground and that I have my answer. ...
Thank you so much for giving me some hope.  I really do appreciate it.
I'm WELL AWARE that all relationships require work.  I have several long term relationships that the communication is no where as difficult as it is with me and my two ISTJs (my spouse and mom).    ...
I agree with this and so does my ISTJ.      However, we both disagree with this one.  It's a BIG DEAL!  My ISTJ HATES being wrong and will not admit being wrong even if proven wrong.  And,...

General question for any/all ENFJs reading this.  Are all ENFJs very positive people?  Most that I have met are very positive, glass half full-types.  :)  Also, what Enneagram are you?
I have decided that I need to hang out in the ENFJ forums more often.  I relate so much to ENFJs and you guys are all just so, awesome!  :happy:
I'm so sorry you are going through this.  I've been there.  *hugs* Listening to music and going on walks helps.  Also, surrounding yourself with people who care about you and keeping busy helps too....
I'm TOTALLY like that, too! Although, every now & then I enjoy some downtime. :wink:
Oh, I remember you now. You're the guy who told me about your fetish for wearing women's underwear.
Maybe the better question is, who are YOU? :dry:
Similar to me: I'm 2w3, 9w1, 6w5  I like to base personalities on cognitive functions.  Which cognitive functions you use most have more to do with personality than just E/I preference (IMHO). ...

What kind of rejection was it? Explicit and romantic, probably not. If they just faded away into the background, they might give you an explanation if you assure them it's safe to do so.

Is it too much to ask that someone could fucking know me? Least of all me.
I think the existence of a 12 page thread is fairly good evidence we're hard to read. Both XNFJs are well known as being emotional fort knox. That Fe-Ni or Ni-Fe combination means in practice that we...

I'd join some painfully bad amateur hockey/rugby/soccer teams. In terms of feeling instantly connected to people, sports and music (particularly singing) are definitely the best.

I'm an ENFJ with ADHD.:blushed:

I don't know if PETA people have done it before, but it would be a great idea that those models go naked for at least one day. I'd be MUCH better if fat and obese people of PETA go naked. It would...

The concept of female virginity is a big cause of history's sexism.

I'm interested in seeing other ENFJs' political views and why they support it.   I highly support social democracy. I think that capitalism, while still basically good, does leave people in extreme...

Well, to be more exact it's impossible to put concrete patterns of behaviour in MBTI types. They deal with cognitive and decision-making dynamics, not behaviours. An ENFJ can be an emotional...

Yeah... I'm pretty much the same way... It took me a week to get over a year long relationship.
It was a compliment... You guys are so deep, and you understand the complexity to normal life situations, its awesome!
Morgan, I know EXACTLY what you're saying. Being an ENFJ I dont share my emotions either, and I dont like to explain why or how I feel a certain way- because just like you said there are so many...
Yeah... I have to force my INFJ friend to tell me what his feelings are.... Actually, he doesnt have a problem telling me when he's angry or hurt or upset, he just has a problem explaining WHY. It...
Well I'm certainly glad that i'm not the only one!
But what if that person is the only person that has the power to hurt your feelings? Why tell them the truth if it's mainly them thats upsetting you? I don't reveal things about myself for a reason-...
Haha! No didnt see the edited version.... And i'm sorry that you've had that experience- I've tried to explain to people that I dont just open up and tell stories of my life, you have to have known...
I've had my fair share of people loving me. lol. And they know nothing about me at all. It almost makes me laugh now, except I feel bad for them...
Exactly... Its overbearing. People dont LOVE ENFJ's... they're infatuated with the way we make them feel- and how we're able to bring happiness to any situation
Yes... I don't believe that I've ever experienced a love that would compel me to spend the rest of my life with someone.. And I think that what I've felt has been love, but there are different...
Yeah.. You guys are creepy. lol. Being an ENFJ, i'm used to being able to read people, and I deliberately don't reveal much about myself... But every freaking time I talk to my INFJ friend, he tells...
Oh, its absolutely not attractive. lol. I've dated guys that are jerks, and i've dated nice guys... I much prefer being treated with respect.  Which leads me to a quesiton about love... Do you...
I'm sure that it would be. Even myself, if I met an ENFJ male- I probably wouldnt believe they have honest intentions. Its so confusing for me when I meet a guy that seems genuine, i think that puts...
Yes I always have things planned. lol. I use my sister and her friends as contingency plans. :)  There are usually more enfj's around here.... hmm....
I totally understand! How do you feel when there's not really anything going on? If I'm just having an average day i feel like something is missing- because I dont have strong emotions either way....
Us ENFJs.... we always know just the right thing to say. lol. Its nice to have a support group for when you're misunderstood by almost everyone. I swear, I always intend to do the best thing for...
Aww! Don't feel that way. At least they were experiences you can learn from.... and you know not to date girls like that again. Find yourself a nice ENFJ. I hear they're wonderful. :tongue:  ...
Aww! you always know how to make me feel better :laughing: lol     How could that make someone weak!? I find it to be a more mature approach to solving problems. You cant just go back and...
Thank you for explaining that in words! haha. Thats exactly how I am, but I can't ever articulate it to the people that are trying to understand. I'll have to just print that out and carry it around...

No, thats awesome. I'm the same way with demands... I'm an intellegent individual, and I can figure things out without someone telling me what i HAVE to do. I absolutely hate that. lol. If someone...
How can I fix that though? lol. Its who I am... I dont try to flirt, and if I did I'd feel like a fool.  I have assumed that its based on the fact that I'm always nice and I like making people...
Seemed like it was too late to revive too much love so I'm adding a part 2! This is kinda different anyway...  Here it goes...   Why does it seem like any male that I'm friends with decides...
Hm. That prompted me to add some photos of myself... we both have dark hair. lol. and we're younger.... seems thats where the physical similarities end.
Are you serious!? omg! ur like my twin! scarrryyy! there are two of us in this world! haha. do you have a myspace or something? I'm dying to see what you look like- maybe we're physically similar!
haha. I just feel like everyone would get along a lot better if we all tried to understand one another. It would make true motives more clear.

Haha, I can let it be percieved as such

Well I guess I'm just gonna have to please all these ladies.    Seducible ENFJ male; ready to to play
*One glass of wine down*   Hey! It's not our fault people wrongly believe INFJs are more interesting than us
Why, that sounds smashing! I believe I'm starting to build up an appetite
I recieve a mention, but all these rather dope individuals somehow were missed? How?
Nah. Sorry, but it just makes you look grotesquely beautiful
What's everybody else wearing?
I honestly don't know what that is, but I want to take it as a compliment lol. Idk, I'm sure I do at least some days
Whoa. I had no clue the Swedish named a town after me. I'll have to go on a pilgrimage one day.

Thank you for the well wishes, so far everything is going well and I have a few people who are pretty good with typing helping me out on the side. I found it something interesting, yet troubling to...
Not in the way that you are thinking.. We have dated a long time ago in the very far past when we were in high school together, and during the relationship we felt very uncomfortable as sexual...
I have little experience with ENTJs, but my closest friend who is one is normally a very fun-loving person who generally gets along with everyone, and most people describe his personality as cold....
I would say that I have that same picture perfect memory, haha. Usually art is something I can escape to, or just playing around online, but with my new job which requires quite a bit of my time...
I was wondering, is it normal for an ENFJ not to care about other people's feelings?   Lately I've been having issues with caring about other people because I feel like there won't be anyone to do...
This is a bit too true! Whenever I tell people I'm offended over something I always get the: You're angry? reply xD
I've run into your issue many, many times. I often find myself feeling like others will never give me the type of support I give them because of their own personal reasons that are unknown to me. A...
The intelligence and calmness.  I'm currently romantically involved with an INTP and those are the main traits of his I find most attractive.
Something fruity.. I can only see ENFJs having something sweet, and fruity as a chocolate bar.
You're not a terrible person, haha.  Just the opposite in fact.  I've always been a bit jealous of your types because of the way you guys can debate.  It's something that I can't do because I get far...
[SPOILER]  It may be that the way you argue makes him feel uneasy.  My closest friend is an ENTJ and when we argue he points out all the faults of the problem we're having then demands answers, but...

This sounds really fun I might join too if that's ok.  :3 I take a while though.......
I have.. there was this one woman I dated for a little bit longer then a year, and we were on and off about 6 - 7 times.  It was emotional hell.  She cheated at one point, I lost feelings for a...
I'm sorry this happened to you.. any break up isn't all that fun, but you shouldn't feel guilty at all none of this was your fault.  I'm sure you're a really amazing person, but it might be that he...
No not at all!  The only troubles we encounter so far is emotional understanding.  Sometimes he comes off a bit more distant then he actually means to, or I'll overreact about something he said...
But what makes you tick?  I'm not really sure how to go about this question, but when it comes to my darker side I'm not a nice person.  I tend to lash out at people who are close to me because...
I used to.  For a while I never let anyone know anything about my past, or even who I really was because I was scared that they would just leave, but after a long time of doing this I found out that...

You're very welcome! I hope it works out for the best for you.  :) I used to be quite similar to you when being scared of bluntness, but if you're not blunt then neither of you will know what...
Why don't we make one?  I know the INTPs use tiny chat.  I'm sure we could do that as well, and maybe even get someone to make a thread about it.  Every time we go on just post on the thread that...
The blood of those poor innocent women will be on your hands when I hulk-out.

I'm involved with an INTP romantically right now, and it's by far the best relationship I've had.  He'll explain things I don't understand logically, and I'll do the same in turn when he's having...
Oh gosh, my boyfriend ( Bloodbraid ) talks to many people.  He went to a party for one of his exes and I freaked out, but never said so for almost 5 days.  In the end I freaked out at him when he...
Ermergurrd!  I can relate to everything here except for 2..  I get angry pretty quickly haha.
I send many internet hugs, and hope you feel better haha. *hugshugshugs*

I'm pretty bold with my romantic declaration but when I've been rejected I take a hint.  I never usually say I'm interested in someone right away .. I wait for the right time when both of us know...
An ENFJ and an INTP would make a nice couple because they can both teach each other amazing things!  However, the only problems that I've ever encountered (dating an INTP currently) is the lack of...
I guess it depends on what the situation is for me.  It seems lately the more stressful the situation is the less I can control my emotions, and during arguments my anger tends to let my emotions on...
I get people who do this all the time to me, but mostly at work.  They will flat out tell me they dislike me (Which I'm fine with, but I still act professional about it by not starting any drama) and...
My immediate family is pretty dysfunctional, and my extended is fairly distant but from what I've gathered over the years they all happen to be more normal then mine.    My parents are divorced and...
That seems normal to me honestly.  During high school, work, and pretty much anywhere that's the same for me.  I also find people being nice to me because I come off as too nice  I'm not sure if...
There was this girl I was dating, and she loved playing with my feelings.  When I finally had the guts to let her go she freaked out on me and guilt tripped me for days.  One day I got so annoyed...
I have bruises all over proving I am clumsy. :(
I guess, be blunt with her.  I went through a phase where I would do something similar about art for a short time, and my best friend pulled me aside one day and told me what I was doing wrong.  He...
Haha!  That's awesome :)  'Blinking' would be very fun indeed.  I had an idea for a villian once where she had a 'blinking' ability but she used it on other things rather then herself.  For example,...

Oh goodness!  I hoard so many things for sentimental reasons ... whether it be music, drawings, scraps of paper, a poem, texts, or even bottles.  I have little things I like to bring with me...
I find INTPs enjoyable.  My boyfriend is an INTP and we've had our fights, moments of terror, and unbelievable happiness.  He teaches me things I've never really known about, and the more information...

This is a very fascinating piece that I can see having patterns of in my own life. I feel that I would like to do more research on the subject matter, however elements of it feel very true for me.
Yeah, not to provide an obvious statement, but I think it's purely our extroversion that makes us less mysterious. We have more of a need to connect with others consistently, and because of it, we're...
Possibly. Though, correct me if I'm wrong, I find people who are Fi can be more difficult with their feelings because of how they process them internally. Whereas people who are Fe I find more...

Wow. Black mail. Very much NOT legal.

I dont think so I think its because no other type comes close to extensive internet useage like 5s. Stuff like forums swarm of 5s and it makes sense that on a PersonalityForum its even more so.

Do they have it more difficult because they are Fe users and their 4ness is more based on their Ni, making it harder to find stability that feels real and meaningful?

I think this is odd behavior for an ENFJ. The behavior you're describing sounds introverted.  Maybe he's intimidated?

This would bug me, too.   The answer for me, would be: after a while, you can't make it up. Just stop doing it. Period. That's it.

Idk about how well sex and food correlate with personality type, but maybe with each other? That'd be an interesting thing to research!
I also disagree.  I think it's simply more obvious when extraverts are spastic or obnoxious.  The nature of extraversion is merely that feelings are divulged more easily and processed externally...

I agree the society is influential! lots of things are influential. I am just saying that it is possible that the stars also have an impact
No doubt that the forer affect exists. And I don't buy my 'horoscopes' by chance, but my sign definitely bc none other than my own fully describes me. idk I know it is not comparable to mbti at all....

Not trying to compare MBTI to horoscopes haha I have just always wondered if the position of the sun and moon actually influences who we are or how we act.   Astrology is an interesting idea to...
What's your sign?  feel free to discuss. I am a Leo which is known for being passionate and I am also very Fe so I didn't know if that had anything to do with each other.

Gosh, i could totally relate to this girl you're talking about. Hmm what i think, though i may be mistaken, is that whenever someone new comes along (in this case, you) and i'm really into him and...
Hmm, just had to reply to this! I know this sounds corny but i strongly believe that if you have to change yourself just so that someone would notice you, then maybe that person isn't the right one...
Just out of curiosity, so STs are less likely to get into relationships with people they're close to? Doesn't make much sense to me to be honest because don't you form a strong connection and bond...

Definitely. You sound like the complete opposite of me! (so i figure it has nothing to do with personality type like you mentioned). For me, no one takes me seriously because they believe i'm a...

Same here! The closer i am to someone, the less guilty i feel in saying what i want directly. But it still occurs very very rarely. Do you receive compliments well? Because for example, if i top the...

Yeaa sounds very familiar :) i'd rather avoid a person than confront the issue.
So sorry for the extremely late reply! I've been so caught up with exams and all. Firstly, thank you for replying to this thread :) And well, i've had enough time to think about it and yes, the lack...

So far, my INFP friends are really very feminine. As compared to my INFJ friends. I find that INFPs are gentler and more co-operative and go with the flow sort and just embodies being feminine...'"

Yes. In my experience they very much DO enjoy being smothered. And enjoy smothering.

My brother is an ISTP and so I know where you're coming from. We ENFJs aren't intentionally manipulative. That's why we seem oblivious. My bro & I are pretty tight tho, so don't give up on all of us...

I had a very good one with both my parents
we are stubborn perfectionists
nah most of the stuff on dating sites is fake if you wana date you should do it in real life
I think its best to be open with people rather then keeping pain inside i used to keep things to myself and that was the reason i was unhappy most of the time just be open
Yeah because they dont value what they have until its gone
egg and tea
amazing speech
Its good to have knowledge but if you are going to classify you will have very little options left still to each his own
during work i am an extroverent aside from work i am an introverent
when you are a perfectionist
Phone  purse keys ballpoint
hermionie of course
no never in my life
aweosum for you
coffee nah i like tea
No i am the only one in my family who is an infp

me i tend to adopt the best of peoples abilities and make them my own
congratulations
yeah obvious isnt it
I dont believe any kind of classification can be 100 percent valid as human nature is aklways changing and growing
Every talented person is always different what matters is how you take a stand that alone give you appreciation or bullying
It depends on your own perspective i think sex is sacred and i should wait for the right person to have it with its not just a physical activity  its more then that but to each his own
koftey naan and sweerdish with tea
by adapting you are slowly moving towards a change
i didnt mean to offend you or anything
I will tell you a secret girls are great but dont revolve your life around them needless to say i wish you the best of luck go and have fun with that one D

Thank you very much, I am going to get started right away!
Really? I'm curious now....I kind of feel like I want to go in there and fix it all up and make everyone friends again!
Oooh..now I've got lots and lots of questions for you penguinfrk!  I have wanted to have a blog, but I don't know whats cool and whats not in the blog world...where is a good place? How to start? I...
Everyone will wake up tomorrow morning with the ability to use 5% more of their brain. Just 5%, its a small ask!!!!! Just imagine what we could achieve with that 5% collectively!
I just tend to have a belief, no matter what comes my way, that people are good and that people will choose to do the right thing rather than the wrong thing in most situations...and perhaps thats...
Very powerful post! I think I love your mum too!!! You may have temporarily lost the connection, but a mamma who loves her baby boy like she loved you doesn't ever stop loving him...and while the...

Yep, I would agree with gurlygurl here. I love to communicate. I'm just fussy about who I communicate with and what I communicate to whom. I really don't have anyone in my life at the moment whom I'd...

You say I have polluted by body with tattoos and in the next breath tell me you are not here to judge??????

5118: I don't know man, that just sounds like someone who is depressed, regardless of type.
Wh1zkey I have a colleague who I suspect is ESTP and wondered why he seems to often gravitate towards me. We don't really work together that much but whenever he sees me he makes conversation and is...
Any thoughts would be appreciated. :happy:
Not really! I like the shy ones and if anything want to keep them to myself rather than share the secret that is their awesomeness.
Love inspires me. Being alive inspires me.
Isn't that to an extent the same thing? Think about it.... (or don't)
Promethea I choked on my tea
I noticed (both here and IRL) that a lot of INTPs worry about the future and 'what happens if I do this and that', which is great for planning and setting yourself up in the most beneficial position...
uncertain aw you guys are sooooo macarons! Teeny weeny little cute flavoursome macarons. Like breakfast cereal macarons.  Lol the Ferrero Rocher was kind of a little joke between the ENFJs. I hope...
Daniel_James_Maher We eat them like crazy over here in the UK.
I respect someone more if they disagreed and called me out than if they silently disagreed and continued to form an unsubstantiated opinion of me. The latter happens waaay more often than the former...
Ahh, my reasoning is that KitKats are your bog standard chocolate. Society's most popular break bar and very much a staple in any scenario (at least involving snacks)... Like an ISTJ: reliable, no...
grandpa2390 I meant to say, information not IRRELEVANT  Oops!
Little pockets of knowledge which contribute to an overall network... Was the best I could come up with. Then again I don't understand INTPs that well so counter arguments are welcomed!
I posted this over in the ENFJ forum and wanted to get some opinions on my estimations of each type as a chocolate or candy. What do you think? :D   Rationals:   ENTJ - Lion Bar ENTP - Pop...

@Chris Knight  I think some ENFJs' appearance of unwavering confidence is a little intimidating to others but what should be realised is that we are human too. Nobody is perfect or has it all...
There's a melancholy in his words that appeals to me on a personal level, I'm sure a little bit of that has to do with being an ENFJ :)
You don't have to feel useless! Nothing wrong with determining situations using feelings. For me, feelings BECOME fact. And I'm a teacher, so I have somewhat of a basis and experience :)  I think...
I've noticed ESFPs being quite good at reading people in the immediate moment, but not understanding motives (or the dynamics of Ni)  ISTJ/INTJs are surprisingly accurate too. But they don't...
One day, and I strongly believe it will be very soon, you will realise, that you should not have let me go.  And I will have moved on.
I find people with underbites really cute!
How about the classic?  81158  I feel the sophisticated packaging represents us too.
Absolute bliss! Could I play my rendition of Passenger's 'Let Her Go' that I've recently learned too? :)
I have 2 INFJ best friends and they are absolutely amazing. They get me. In every way. But there's a pay off. I find them scarily intense sometimes when I just want to be superficial and light, or...
Go for it! Awesome pairing.
Information was not relevant.... I'm glad you shared it. If you ever feel self conscious about that kind of content again feel free to PM mr
Clearly the best character.
Not to mention extremely pleasant to look at. The mere sight of us is happiness-inducing ;)
I'm curious as to your thought processes during the time that you contacted the person who would've been in my situation, would you care to elaborate?
I'm finding myself in a very strange situation now where he's thanking me for opening his eyes to a lot of factors about his personality and being on the receiving end of some long ass messages from...
It's like looking in the friggin mirrorrrr

Devil They sound amazing! Definitely going to sign up on my return to the UK. And East to West is probably a longer commute than from where I live to my ENTJ! Well done! And thank you :)
Devil Strutting is one of my fave hobbies. So yessss! I am going to see where it goes with this ENTJ. The feelings for him never left despite my short lived romance with the INTP (boy you were...
The ENTJ in discussion has on more than one occasion told me he's attracted to my intellect, independence and creativity (blowing my own horn a bit there) and in a social context I do tend to...
That's the opposite of my ENTJ experience. Apart from one time when we were at loggerheads with each other over how I supposedly made the wrong choice of love interest (read: not him) we have been...
Interesting... Could you elaborate on this?

I'd wait. I'm sure most of us would. It's all worth it in the end when the expressions come out :)
But it's not! Just express the feelings. We can't always know how you feel. You guys internalize way to well. Show us the Happiness!
Then we can tear them down quickly and efficiently! :D
If cuddles and snuggles are your layers, I think us ENFJs can out layer you :)
I'm always down for that :)
It's worth the patience and effort :D
Not weird at all. Many woman want that kind of thing. You just happen to be more specific. We'd totally fall in love with your caring side and make it come out more. Or at least try to. And we would...
I'm trying to balance that myself as well. It's true, listening too much can be an issue. You have a voice and it should be able to get a point or thought across :)
Definitely confront her about it. She would likely appreciate you sharing your thoughts with her and would wanna solve any issues or questions you may have :)

I have a few INTJ friends as well and I greatly appreciate having them  around! They tend to be very perceptive and knowledgeable and are in general excellent at giving unbiased advice.  While I...
Do you feel the same about other healthcare professions? I know nursing was mentioned at the last page and I study to become a physical therapist myself, which I've found to be very rewarding. Being...
To me, looking after your appearance is about self-respect. I can increase my sense of well-being by taking care of myself, kind of giving myself a pat on the back. Living as a sloth for a period of...
Congratulations Danny, best of luck!:proud:
What exactly are you looking for when you look for information? Like tutorials and guides?
ISTJ and ISTP has been suggested earlier and out of the two I have to say ISTJ is more likely. I can see Te-Fi much stronger than Ti-Fe in him. He also seem to be more here and now as opposed to...
I get a strong Fi from you. You seem to have a strong set of ethics and morals which you use to judge the external world with and get upset when they clash.  Can't really tell if you are Ne or Se...
esme23  Welcome to PerC! I hope it will live up to your expectations. :happy:  When it comes to your friend, don't fall into the trap of typing him based on stereotypes! There can be HUGE...
I would say Se and Fi are the two strongest functions actually.  Se in the following: #2 - Quickly taking action with focus on the immediate problem. #3 - Also very here and now, focus seem to be...
How is she when you talk to her otherwise and how old is she?  Some people are more comfortable being lead by someone in casual conversation, especially if she likes you and gets a bit...
Correct me if I am wrong now, but I think most of your points are skills and abilities whereas the cognitive functions are about how you process and value information. You could find that alot of...
Honestly, I am happy if I manage to pull that off in a week. Not just to the person of my affections, but to everyone I know combined!
Welcome to PerC!  Nice of you to join us!:happy:
Just curious, is there a reason for you not wanting to go to medical school, or is it just that you don't need any input on that?
In English: Flowing, pure, serene, grotesque, falling, ringing.  In Swedish: Tindra (glisten), saga, klok (wise), Ã¶de (fate), hed (moor), klinga (ringing).  While I usually think English is a...
It is a tough question to answer since there is so much more to a girl than her cognitive functions to make her attractive or unattractive... I think the functions are more likely to catch my...
Considering my lack of sleep, I am impressed you could interpretate anything of what I wrote!:laughing:   But yeah, I really agree with you. Though I think it's easier than one would believe to get...
dulcinea I can partly recognize what you are talking about in myself at times, especially when talking to someone I don't know very well who is a bit on the shy side. It makes it so much harder to...
I am not quite following you. Experience of what? Getting hurt?    I apologize if I have missed something, but I didn't think this what about seeing multiple people at the same time? That is not...
Don't count out the introverts! Most of them can be very welcoming as well!:wink:
I see where you are coming from, but isn't it really just a matter of if the glass is half empty or half full? I can as easily say that I have never met a nice guy who didn't think he was a douche...
Well, you could start looking up a few articles on the subjects you are interested in, or if you prefer, you can look up the what is my personality/enneagram forums and get help from people...
Welcome to PerC!  I hope your stay here will be a pleasant one!
Welcome to PerC!  Don't put too much faith in those web based tests, sometimes they do nothing else than confuse you. As you become more familiar with the different types you'll have an easier...
Welcome to PerC!  Be sure to tell keep us up to date on your game!:happy:
FiddleheadFern I really think you are on to something there! Like when you are sailing, you can't make the wind and weather change to enable you to follow that perfect route to your destination....
I have to agree with everyone else, some kind of limbo-esque state is really terrible.  However, I do think there is a point when you feel bad enough to prefer apathy. When the negative emotions...
This exactly.  I can really relate to the opinion that just dating is pointless and a waste of time, but in myself it mostly comes down to over-analyzing it. If you stop thinking about getting...
Open question now, do you feel a necessity for an afterlife or a higher purpose in life?  Being born through chaos or some kind of accident suggests that we have made it to where we are as a...
I would have guessed that I had a stronger Ni, but the teacher subtype fitted me like a glove.  The name is kind of fitting, I sometimes feel the urge to teach people to do things my way. Since...'"


5532: 'YES! I absolutely love this one, I've stumbled upon it before and it kind of blew my mind a little the first time I saw it. It makes total sense too. And it actually takes some pressure off the...
You're right, I want my creative work to be a second career. It's not quite there yet, but I'm starting to get a little bit more serious with it. So yes, I do put pressure on it. Maybe the keys lies...
Ah yes, you describe it well. I both love it and is afraid of sharing, especially to a new crowd or something I'm not sure if it's good enough. But it's so fun to share too. It's true for my work -...
Happy, I love the word self-handicap. It describes it well.   I agree with doing it every day makes it easier. I have a tendency to do a lot work for a while, working almost every day and then for,...
Hi fellow lovely ENFJs!  As a writer and aspiring author I've struggled with fears when trying to do my creative work. First, the fear that I'm not good enough and doing any kind of work would be a...
Thank you! It feels a bit more hopeful today. And I know, something is gonna work, sooner or later.
I'm so tired of life right now.  I have since last summer a job as the leader of a student organization and I spent the fall working 60-80 hours a week with high pressure and responsibility. I'm...
Interesting! I'm a cusp too between Taurus and Gemini. I'm Taurus but if I was born another year I could have been Gemini. It's a weird combination, really two totally different signs. Never read a...
I've also heard something similar to you'll never be happy - that he doesn't have almost any demands on the relationship while I have too many. I agree that pushing isn't a very good method and...
Thank you all for your responses!     Your description is extremely accurate for my situation. The only thing I don't experience is your second point about So, but my boyfriend is in MBTI terms...
Hi!  I've figured out that I'm Sx/Sp and my boyfriend is Sp/So. Does anyone else have experiences of this combination? Do you have any advice for me? I've realized we aren't the easiest combination...
I do this too, and it's useful but dangerous. If we are too much of a chameleon we are so affected by who we are with, and we loose ourselves. I've realized that I mirror some of my boyfriends...
Yes, I run and I love it! Usually run at night with music, to clear my head. Works great!  I read somewhere that ENFJs were the type most likely to deal with stress by running, so there is probably...
I've come to the same conclusion. When I stop waiting for things to happen or for others to do the things I want to do with me, and go for them myself, just because I want to, then I become a happier...
With a healthy and understanding ENFJ, you don't need to be bossy to express your need for independence. We get it anyway. My ISTP isn't bossy at all and I respect his need for independence.

I hope it works out for you! :)
To be fair, it has mostly happened with people who I've gotten to know through partying with them. But I might hide my intuitive side from people I don't know. It feels like the more private,...
I don't think that's necessarily true. We have reversed functions - but the same functions. That makes us the same but still very different. In other words, we often have similar values and think the...
That is sooooo interesting! I've been told by new friends that they didn't think I had that much depth to me and I've read here a few times about people having the same experience. One would think...
Oh MY god. I have so much to do.   I'm working for a student organization for a year and we are only two people working full time in the organisation, me as the representative for the organisation...
Well, even if we have the same functions, communication isn't necessarily easy. I'm with an ISTP and have read about others and what people keep coming back to is that communication is key to make...
This is exactly it. I think we manipulate and do other things to affect other people's behavior because we get influenced by others all the time. It's natural for us.   That being said, it's not a...
I work out a bit irregularly but when I do it for a while it becomes an addiction pretty quickly. I also store up my anxiety and stress in my body and I easily get back pains and such. Training...
We ENFJs tend to see brightly on the future and we have our goals that we want to reach no matter the hardship. For me in terms of kids that means I don't care if the first years will be hell, I...

Thank you, I will use this approach. You are a wise man.
Haha okay I see the difference. The end of the alternative sounds a bit manipulative to me though. ...because I like spending time with you, meaning if you don't do this then you don't like to...

It will get better! Remember that she is putting you in this situation too, so she is also responsible for your health. Hopefully you moving out will also reduce your stress and improve your mental...
Yeah, I know, I have drifted apart from almost all of my old friends. It's how it works I guess, but it's sad. Hugs!
I agree that it's important, and that speculating isn't really leading anywhere! I have talked to him about it but I will try a bigger discussion about it. I'm not home at the moment so I've used...
I agree, it's really tough. I keep thinking how when I actually do get a really close female friend, I'm gonna look back at this time and realize how much not having one was getting me down. It's...
Interesting that so many of us have the same experience with mothers.     Be strong and look out for yourself! Moving helps a lot, I moved 5 hours away so she could only reach me fast on phone....
I think I know how you feel. I was best friends with an ESFP for 10 years and when I moved to another town to study and the friendship needed a little effort from her side, she didn't do shit. I was...
I'm definitely a shy extrovert. I'm usually shy with new people and can be awkward with people I don't know too well. I find it easier to be social if I'm in some kind of role, like if I need to be...
I don't know the theoretical explanation for it, but it seems like sensing fuels judging a bit. Guessing it has to do with sensors being more grounded and to a larger extent lives in their senses.  ...
Whatever type you are, you interest me.   If you are ENFJ with a somewhat complicated relationship to your Fe, you could use Ti as a way to shield your emotions. From others and from yourself.  ...
Dear ISTP boyfriend,  I more and more realize I have no idea what goes on in your head. It's starting to freak me out. I look forward to your next random blurt of thoughts.  Sincerely, with love,...

If my partner isn't bringing up any considerations about the relationship, that freaks me out. My ISTP boyfriend never really brings up any issue and I know we have our issues (I bring them up!). So...
You are very welcome to use MBTI as a game. What you said though is that you know it's more of a game. I know there are troubles with finding empirical evidence for the functions and I surely agree...
Hi Platena and welcome to PerC!   It all sounds pretty ENFJ to me. I don't know where you read we are supposed to be good at expressing our feelings - we have a tendency to be scared of asking for...

Being an ENFJ with many social inhibitions, sometimes I wonder what that would be like. I might be a little envious, but I feel I would stop being so damn classy, and I wouldn't want that :wink:

About your ISTJ friends, you should really hold back from expressing any sort of emotions around them. I hear ISTJs are one of the most socially difficult people to be around with. When you say that...
what on earth? this is power of ENFJ male? pretty damn gay. go read my post about ENFJs and homosexuals.
no worries.
In this thread, we like to ramble on like a bunch of twelve year olds, now that's objective criticism.
I disagree, I believe that objective criticism is necessary, but only when its coming from a valid source or someone I respect. I see people force objective criticism onto others, thats kind of when...
not for you... lol jk.  but yeah. I was being particular about ENFJ because I feel this be our greatest nemesis.
I agree. Perfectionism pays off, but if used the wrong way, it can be damaging.
Hello, I just wanted to clear some things out because it seems like Perfectionism and Criticism has finally become a hot topic as our ENFJ section is starting to grow. I really want all ENFJs to know...
Perfectionism is a sickness not an ability. Stop encouraging it, its disturbing, your lack of knowledge and my unwillingess to let this slide as misunderstood humor...
So you want to feel superior and elitist over the average and normal people?
I told my INTP roommate about what you said and he says Hi:happy:
I used to be and still recovering from being a big time unhealthy perfectionist. A book called Procrastination by Jane Burka and Too Perfect by Allan Mallinger really helps you understand the Ups...
I need details on the You use your usual charm and bag of tricks. What do you mean by that?

Because where I come from, being nice means you're gay.
coudln't agree more with you on that one.   Thats why I got confused because on here it says ISTJs often work for long periods, devoting their energy to tasks that they see as important to...
I never knew we revert to our unhealthy shadow functions during stressful times. I guess that explains a lot then.
I'm an ENFJ and I feel the same way too. In fact, its exactly the same. I just took another myers briggs test and my results showed me as ISTJ and I came into this section and found a lot of things I...
I'm sure a lot of us are aware of the notion of the bright and dark side of an ENFJ. We go through stages of depression as it escalates. We have trouble being alone and if kept isolated for a good...
Theres no need to defend anyone here. I just wanted to make sense out of something that didn't make sense. Stop distorting the truth.

I'm not too sure if ENFJs are easily influenced. Its more like, they naturally adapt to the situation the best they can but I hope most of you know whats good for you when it comes down to it. ENFJs...
Do most ENFJs tend to be Homo-sexual? I've been noticing a lot of gay people in this section. I mean I'm totally neutral about homo-sexuality, just leave that to politics, I even have friends who're...
I'm just wondering what the previous post meant. Also, let me undo your poor manipulated fallacy, being a healthy ENFJ or a balanced one has nothing to do with any of this, I just want to make sure...
that made no sense, influenciable isn't even a word.
This is why I'm uncomfortable around ENTJs. Theres two ENTJs in my frat. One is cool I like him, the other dude annoys the hell out of me. Long story short, he reminds me of a serial killer, he has...

I notice how I easily get any type of girls. always bring out the best in them from the freaky-side to whatever I want it to be. uhhhh not bragging just saying. I'm ENFJ btw. I don't have to ask for...
I never knew ENFJs were capable of doing drugs. :crazy:
What area in LA are you at?
We actually had this thread before. If you look at the INTJ section, you'll realize their section is very much alive. They even start social projects and experiments together over the forums.   ...
but they were just done explaining to me that INFP and INTPs are similar. My roomies INTP he's pretty laid back.
Well me being a male and all I can't afford to put on a :angry: to ward off attention.
Thats exactly it! you hit the spot with the a) I feel like me deep down inside and b) I'm upset that I'm not me. Theres always this lingering feeling where I'm mad at myself but didn't know why,...'"

My ex (a fellow ENFJ) had a ton of gay guy friends that she always hung out with.  Maybe you've got something to your theory here.
Care to explain?  I'm only two months deep with an INFJ and this is probably the best relationship I've ever had, including one that lasted almost 15 years.  I've never had a relationship where so...

This may not be that helpful, but I can tell you one thing, if she is truly an ENFJ then you aren't stuck in the middle ground.  She's either interested in you or she's completely disinterested.  ...

Yeah, that does sound like a very unhealthy one.  It was mentioned in another thread on here this week, but cheating for an ENFJ is pretty rare.  Good thing you got away from that one.

Next time you run into something like this you could point out that misapplying one type of test to a completely different result is a better indicator of who the least intelligent person is.
Efficiency is great and all, but a little fumbling shouldn't set him off. Going off in public being even worse. There's either something else, or he's very immature.
You're describing a narcissist I had the exact same problems with. You have to put your foot down. It only gets worse, not better.
So far I kind of agree with the not so healthy ENFJ..   What do you do when you procrastinate?
